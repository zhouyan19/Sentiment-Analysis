this
is
an
event
i
will
never
forget
i
am
considered
a
good
mimic
this
particular
day
we
were
waiting
for
a
professor
to
take
her
class
this
professor
had
a
peculiar
accent
and
a
very
horrible
way
of
lecturing
and
to
top
it
all
we
had
this
class
at
the
fag
end
of
the
day
so
this
particular
day
i
got
into
my
element
and
started
imitating
the
professor
,
and
the
professor
entered
the
class
right
in
the
middle
of
it
i
was
unaware
of
her
presence
,
some
of
my
friends
tried
to
warn
me
but
it
was
of
no
avail
as
i
was
too
engrossed
in
mimicing
then
i
suddenly
noticed
the
silence
and
turned
around
to
see
her
entering
the
class
i
do
not
know
till
today
if
she
actually
saw
what
i
had
been
doing
or
she
had
completely
ignored
it
through
out
that
lecture
i
died
of
shame
all
the
more
shameful
was
the
fact
that
she
gave
me
a
character
certificatewhen
i
was
blamed
for
some
of
my
attributes
which
are
very
often
misunderstood
,
especially
when
one
is
very
frank
fights
that
i
see
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
robberies
,
fear
of
darkness
when
going
homeon
tv
i
saw
a
report
about
church
in
amerika

priest
was
shown
who
was
performing
miracles
in

of

camera

felt
disgusted
when

schhol
friend
(

)
who
works
in
sk
vdewhen
i
opted
for
my
research
field
,
for
them
the
percentage
of

was
more
important
than
my
knowledge

wanted
to
go
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
a
party
at
the
moment
i
wanted

a
scene
of
shooting
in
front
of
my
house
,
i

my
fear
lasted
for
quite
some
time
my
fear
disappeared
only
after
the
list

was
afraid
before
i
went

that
the

had
been
associating
with
for
over
a
year

out
2
or
3
times
with
a
high
school

whom
he
claimed
not
to
like

walk
with

met
a
drunk
womani
was
angry
when
someone
stole
a
magazine

i
had
borrowed
from
another
friend
and
locked
it
in
a
drawer

with
a
nice
girli

holy
week
,
and
a

approached

cheating
for

arrived
too
late
at
a
meeting
of
mentor
(
the
night
before
the
introduction
of
novices
on
the
university
start
)
i
saw
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
suffered
a
very
heavy
contusion
after
an
accidentafter
an
event
in
which
i
felt
that
i
had
acted
unfairly
the
day
after
the
night
i
drank
too
much
at
a
partywhen
i
offended
my
parents
without
wanting
it
most
recently
when
the
chairman
at
the
new
zeeland
rugby
union

the
invitation
of
south
africa
to
play
rugby
in
that
countryi
used
to
play
with
a
group
of
classmates
and
i
found
out
later
that
they
were
cheap
in
thought
,
behaviour
and
conduct
they
would
smoke
,
fight
and
speak
foul
language
i
thought
that
they
destroyed
the
image
of
college
students
when
a
girl
left
medead
rat
in
the
kitchen
of
the
university
i
wanted
to
borrow

from
the
dean
of
my
school
congratulating
me
for
my
performance

candidature
number
on
the
admission
list
of
the
chinese
university

was
satisfied
and
happy
and
the
cumulative
anxiety

only
wanted
to
cry
out
that
i
had
succeededwhen
i
was
caught
sneaking
back
into
the
house
at

after
having
gone
to

t
describe
a
particular
casei

filling
my
tax
report
nobody

a
friend
of

a
wonderful
present

my
birthday
i
enjoyed
having
that
present
when

hide
a
fact
from
a
person
for
irrelevant
reasons
and
considered
such
an
attitude
childishi

been
living
in
an
overseas
city

come
home
about
12
months
before
i
met
a
whole
new
set
of
friends
,
leaving
them
at
the
airport
was
sad
and
traumatic
as
they
had
helped
me
in
many
ways
and
i
knew
i
wouldn
'
t
see
many
of
them
again
i
most
joyous
moment

hale
and
hearty
and
full
of
life
,
with

diedbeing
made
to
look
like

fool
by
a
girl
when

to
look
after
the

my
last
exam
i
won
a
car
in
a
prize
competition
the
moment
i
was
informed
about
it
,
i
felt
joywhen
i
found
out
how
the
people
of
ethiopia
were
starving
and
their
government
was
spending
millions
on
celebrating
being
in
power
so
many
years
then
i
saw
all
these
people
on
tv
needing
food
,
etc

i
almost
ran
over
a
small
boy

suddenly
was
in

girlfriend
wrote
to
me
telling
me
that
she
was
four
months
pregnant

that
i
was
responsible
for
the
damages
this
made
me
happy
as
i
longed
to
have
a
child
to
call
minewhen
my
parents
behave
very
witty
towards
me
,
they
make
insipid
jokes
about
which
they
laugh
or
my
mother
who
treats
me
like
a
little
child
i
often
feel
guilty
,
and
it
has
to
do
with
other
people
,
e
g
if
i
haven
'
t
visited
my
older
relatives
for
a
whilewhen

they
thought
was
improper

bad
on

test
i
didn
'
t
study
forafter
a
terrible
quarrel
with
my
family
,
i
withdrew
in
my
room

guilty
because
i
had
caused
this
scene
by
my
aggressive
behavior
a
few
days
back
i
had
to
ask
a
professor
a
ridiculous
question
because
i
had
lost
at
a
game
of
cards
and
had
to
pay
a
forfeitwhen
i
saw
a
girl
in
my
economics
discussion
section
smiling
and
asking
stupid
questions
to
the
ta
just
to
get
attention
she
was
obviously
ass
kissing
it
happens
in
every
econ
discussion
held
weekly
when
i
came
to
know
that
my
exams
were
on
two
successive
days
and
that
there
was
very
little
time
(
about
9
10
hours
)
to
study
in
betweeni
felt
shame
at
the
hurt
i
caused
to
my
family
especially
my
parent
father
,
shame
of
hurting
people
emotionally
a
misconceived
self
blaming
that
didn
'
t
do
me
any
good
shame
at
being
myself
as
i
am
at
a
friend
'
s
birthday
party
with
some
of
my
closest
friends
it
was
all
very
pleasant
and
one
could
say
that
i
was
happy
to
have
such
good
friendswhen
after
a
night
of
sleeping
in
another
'
s
arms
,
one
wakes
alone
and
knows
that
the
lonely
arms
of
the
night
are
not
the
same
that
one
meets
in
the
morning
that
i
didn
'
t
want
my
friend
to
leave
on
holiday
for
10
days

grocery
when
he
asked
me
who
stole
the
sweets
i

when
i
had
gone

with
my
friends

heard
the
roar
of
a
lion
near

had
to
run
for
our
lives

was
when

had
to
pass
10
hours
a
day
waiting
for

answer
,
which
at
last
was
the
worst
the
fear
of
being
convoked

of
hearing
the
fated
phrase
,
was
constant
a
person

my
advice
,
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
what

saying

acted
as
though
i
wasn

t
even
there
we
were
doing
group
work
so
everybody
had
the
right
to
speak
yet
she
just
ignored
me
she
made
me
feel
insignificantwhen
my
parents
drove
me
to
a
nearby
place
and
went
home
immediately
instead
of
waiting
a
few
hours

could
have
easily
waited

ex
colleague

me
if
i
was
interested
in
working
in
their
accounts

time
i
see
my
best
friend
i
feel
guilt
because
we
can
'

slandered
by
friends
when
my
boy

left
me
and
i
wanted
to
persuade

got
disgusted
with
a
man
who
was
beating
a
woman
in
the
street
i
just
happened
to
be
there
but
i
was
abhorred
by
the
rudness
being
hooted
at
when
i
was
learning
to
drivei
had
a
quarrel
with
a
good
friend
about
the
fact
that
i
didn
'
t
pay
her
a
visit
when
she
expected
me
to
come
hereafter
i
was
very
sad
because
it
became
a
real
quarrel
someone
who
was
speeding
was
forced
to
slow
down
when
i
pulled
out
onto
the
road
and
proceeded
to
abuse
me
at
the
next
set
of
traffic
lightswhen
i
forgot
the
lyrics
during
a
song
contest
my
mother
wants
to
talk
very
often
about
her
life
i
dislike
this
because
she
always
talks
negatively
about
the
same
people
whatever
i
do
it
doesn

t
helpour
teacher
had
invited
us
to
lunch
and
once
at
the
canteen
we
started
introducing
ourselves
two
of
the
boys
showed
a
lot
of
interest
in
knowing
personal
details
and
then
they
started
talking
about
some
activities
held
in
the
college
i
had
little
interest
in
those
activities
so
i
talked
to
another
student
sitting
next
to
me
as
i
was
afraid
that
they
would
ask
me
questions
on
those
activities
i
felt
disgusted
at
my
teams
poor
perfomance
prior
to
league
playwhen
i
got
my
results
i
had
passed
the
form
iii
exams
i
had
not
expected
to
do
so
well
i
had
gone
on
a
vacation
and
my
mother
left
home
without
leaving
me
any
thing
money
to
come
back
to
schoolwhen
dropping
a
carton
of
boiling
soup
onto
a
co
worker
'
s
leg
causing
great
pain
,
and
for
me
,
severe
embarassment
at
my
own
ineptitude
,
and
shame
that
another
person
suffered
as
a
result
i
was
sleeping
nicely
until
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
i
became
awake
because
a
friend
called
me
for
some
(
in
my
opinion
)
nonsens
reasonhaving
to
decide
on
a
termination
of
a
pregnancy
,
after
discussing
it
with
friends
,
family
and
the
man
involved
once
i
offended
a
friend
,
instead
of
her
coming
to
me
to
ask
and
discuss
the
matter
she
was
just
telling
other
people
about
it
and
say
all
she
could
about
memy
parents
claimed
me
on
their
income
tax
after
i
had
been
out
of
the
house
for
two
years
receiving
no
financial
support
from
them
as
result
i
had
to
work
more
during
school
because
they
were
expected
by
the
fao
to
contribute
to
my
education
when
they
refuse
to
do
so
when
one
lets
friends
downwhen
a
group
of
friends
began
to
make
critics
about
me
when
i
first
passed
a
job
interviewwhile
playing
basketball
i
broke
a
team
member
'
s
spectacles
his
face
was
injured
by
the
pieces
of
glass
it
was
not
serious
but
i
felt
guilty
and
blamed
myself
for
being
too
careless
and
vigorous
in
my
game
before
going
to
the
dentisti
was
told
i
shouldn
'
t
visit
my
sister
because
the
holiday
was
short
when
i
noticed
that
a
nice
person
was
being
exploited
economicallyi
was
very
sad
when
i
heard
that
my
uncle
had
passed
away
untimely
at
home
if
i
don
'
t
go
to
lectures
,
i
often
feel
ashamedwhen
,
after
a
week
at
school
,
a
teacher
sent
a
note
home
saying
that
my
son
was
inattentive
and
unable
to
do
his
lessons
a
gang
of
screaming
and
drunk
youths
captured
a
tramin
1960
,
i
was
going
to
a
school
which
was
near
my
village
and
i
met
a
lion
on
the
way
,
which
disappeared
suddenly
when
a
friend
of
me
came
for
an
unexpected
visitthis
is
an
incident
that
many
of
us
witness
in
our
everyday
life
in
a
city
like
bombay
one
day
i
was
travelling
by
bus
,
three
men
dragged
two
fellows
out
of
the
bus
once
outside
they
were
beaten
into
pulp
these
two
fellows
,
who
got
beaten
,
were
pick
pockets
and
they
were
being
beaten
by
all
and
sundry
i
thought
to
myself
what
is
life
?
it
is
one
hell
of
a
place
where
everyone
is
after
someone
else
one
waits
to
cut
the
throat
of
the
other
one
just
for
a
living
,
(
money
)
when
i
think
about
such
things
the
purpose
of
life
,
etc
,
i
feel
very
disgusted
and
dejected
my
father
died
last
year
after
an
8
week
severe
illnesswhen
one
meets
new
people
with
whom
one
is
forced
to
collaborate
with
loneliness
,
being
uncertain
of
myself
in
the
autumni
was
looking
after
a
dying
patient
at
work
one
night
,
a
young
woman
,
my
colleague
was
talking
to
her
relatives
and
to
offer
them
any
support
emotionally
,
physically
and
then
sent
them
down
to
the
coffee
shop
to
have
a
dinner
rather
than
offering
the
facilities
available
for
their
use
cause
it
involved
her
having
to
do
some
work
seeing
them
again
i
felt
disgusted
at
her
attitude
at
an
exam
in
pharmacology
i
tried
to
prompt
a
coleague
(
she
asked
me
something
)
and
the
assistant
professor
made
me
a
sharp
remarki
went
to
a
fair
where
a
guy
who
was
drunk
kept
bothering
me
and
in
the
end
i
got
really
angry
some
time
ago
i
was
disgusted
with
the
cleanness
of
the
refectory
of
our
instituteat
my
job
,
i
got
disproportionately
angry
with
a
child
my
reaction
was
not
as
it
should
have
been
while
reading
olli
jalonen
'
s
new
book
,
the
distant
,
cold
and
selfish
relationships
between
people
(
in
the
book
)
made
me
feel
disgustedwhen
my
wife
gave
birth
to
a
baby
boy
my
only
son
to
date
i
was
drawn
up
a
statement
for
an
infringement
of
the
traffic
ordinance
in
fact
i
was
innocentwe
had
promised
,
with
a
friend
of
mine
,
to
take
our
friends
to
a
restaurant
and
after
having
looked
for
a
place
for
hours
without
finding
one
,
and
not
being
helped
by
the
others
we
had
to
give
up
the
idea
before
the
examnwhen
i
had
an
argument
with
my
best
friend
and
i
thought
that
i
was
right
and
she
was
not
at
a
certain
person
'
s
lack
of
cleanliness
,
at
home
and
personallyi
put
in
two
years
of
hard
work
and
it
was
neither
looked
at
nor
appreciated
when
i
got
home
i
found
that
the
electrical
supply
had
been
disconnected
despite
my
having
paid
zesco
the
full
bill
a
few
days
earliereach
time
the
professor
asks
me
a
question
in
class
winning
a
race
that
i
had
been
training
for
,
for
many
weeks
(
running
race
)my
teacher
asked
me
a
question
which
i
failed
to
answer
and
i
was
told
to
stay
behind
after
the
class
and
give
the
answer
after
studying
it
from
a
book
a
few
months
back
i
had
gone
to
my
friend
'
s
place
and
they
offered
me
tea
and
coffee
i
do
not
have
the
habit
of
drinking
tea
or
coffee
and
so
they
offered
me
a
glass
of
milk
instead
,
so
i
felt
ashameda
person
that
eat
half
of
a
cockroach
in
a
cake
without
knowing
it
before
an
exam
which
i
,
finally
did
not
takeafter
several
days
delay
in
my
girlfriend
'
s
menstration
i
was
very
glad
to
see
that
the
pregnancy
test
was
negative
when
we
rearranged
furniture
in
our
flat
and
got
stuck
in
a
chaira
friend
prepared
a
soup
with
chicken
heads
and
invited
me
to
eat
it
i
saw
the
eyes
staring
at
me
and
the
tongues
hanging
out
of
the
bills
i
was
so
disgusted
that
i
felt
nausea
and
had
to
leave
the
room
i
had
promised
to
send
something
to
a
friend
and
it
completely
slipped
my
mind
i
felt
guilty
for
having
forgottenunfair
and
unjust
attitude
toward
a
person
close
to
me
,
what
i
was
the
witness
of
,
caused
anger
in
me
when
i
decided
to
separate
from
my
husbandwhen
a
good
friend
of
me
told
me
one
evening
that
she
didn
'
t
want
to
live
anymore
many
years
ago
i
saw
the
film
psycho
by
hitchcock
for
the
first
time
when
i
saw
the
film
i
was
alone
and
afterwards
i
hardly
dared
to
go
to
bed
and
hardly
was
able
to
sleepthe
saddest
i
'
ve
ever
been
was
when
my
lover
was
killed
,
hitch
hiking
to
work
reading
about
executions
and
massacres
which
happened
during
world
war
ii
,
i
felt
disgust
towards
those
who
did
itwe
were
on
the
road
in
a
car
when
a
lorry
bypassed
us
we
had
to
swerve
and
we
almost
got
run
over
the
doctors
from
belogradchik
town
determined
a
wrong
diagnosis
to
my
son
a
month
later
,
after
some
complex

at
isul
(
a
medical
institute
in
sofia
)
,
the
diagnosis
was
categorically
rejectedmy
friend
came
to
see
me
after
she
had
stayed
abroad
i
waited
at
the
station
i
was
so
sick
that
my
relatives
thought
that

was
bewitched

felt
like
dyingwhen
i
was
acceptted
as
a
student
of
psychology

was
double
crossing
my
fiancee

one
day
she

ashamed

had
donewe

as
a
child
,
when
i
saw
an
unesthetic
sightwhen
my
brother
ran
away
from

i
thought
it
was
because
of
my
continously
scolding
him

am
disgusted
with
the
behavior
of
a
car
driver
whose
car
would
run
over
me

my
friends
during

autumn
brigadewhen
my

his
excitement
and
overindulged
in
the
notes

though
his
curiosity

an
extreme
behaviour

what
i
was
reading
and
gained
everything
he
couldwhen
i
was

read
it
and
started
teasing
me
about
it
during
my

i
met
again
a
friend
who
had
tried
to
commit
suicide
she
had
just
left

lips
were
trembling
,
she
looked
miserablewhen

fault
that

you
could
call
it
gossip
i
felt
different
after

had
slept
on

not
have
done
it

walking
on
the
street
,
i
slipped
on
the

she
went
to

being
able
to
help
my
friend

this
feeling
when
my
parents

because
they
thought
he
was
bad
and
irresponsiblewhen
i
and

for
my
opinion
i
was
ashamed
because
i
had
no
firm
view
of
the
whole
thing
and
therefor
was
not
able
to
join
the
conversation
when
my
boyfriend
and
i
went
out
for
a
dinner
and
subsequently
went
to
his
family
we
had
a
very
nice
eveningthe
shooting
started
and
we
all
lay
down
to
protect
ourselves
from
the
flying
bullets
this
incident
occured
on
our
way
to
feira
,
during
the
zambia
army
patrols
in
the
rhodesia
war
when
i
found
that
my
ability
to
do
ordinary
work
was
worse
than
my
fellow
mateswhen
a
boy
whom
i
refused
to
be
my
lover
told
all
his
friends
that
i
was
his
girl
he
has
refused
me
because
i
was
not
faithful
to
him
when
i
was
ill
and
had
to
stay
at
the
hospital
for
a
period
of
timei
felt
disgusted
when
somebody
told
me
that
my
previous
boyfriend
was
her
boyfriend
when
i
realized
that
i
belonged
to
a
country
which
is
amongst
the
poorest
in
the
world
and
that
inspite
of
having
the
resources
we
do
not
utilize
them
i
was
ashamed
at
myself
and
my
country
,
shame
at
the
lack
of
parity
between
the
lifestyles
of
the
citizenswhen
my
nephew
was
taken
to
hospital
with
meningitis
and
we
did
not
know
what
would
happen
before
i
went
to
the
urologist
'
s
i
was
afraid
for
several
reasons
because
it
was
for
the
first
time
,
because
the
medical
check
up
might
be
painful
,
because
of
the
uncertainty
and
because
someone
had
informed
me
about
itwhen
the
neighbour
of
a
friend
of
mine
was
stabbed
to
death
by
thieves
in
kabwe
they
stole
his
van
i
had
spent
the
weekend
visiting
relatives
and
friends
and
didn
'
t
study
for
anatomy
class
on
mondaypassing
(
by
car
)
over
a
bridge
where
only
one
car
could
pass
there
was
a
precipice
on
both
sides
,
no
protection
grilles
,
and
the
bridge
was
completely
muddled
while
watching
tv
(
a
war
movie
)
,
i
felt
a
strong
fear
of
death
,
threat
and
fear
of
loosing
people
close
to
mewhile
at
primary
school
,
i
did
not
let
a
friend
ring
a
bell
although
he
would
have
liked
to
do
it
afterwards
i
felt
bad
i
feel
this
feeling
most
often
before
me
not
before
the
others
my
outside
is
iron
but
actually
i
'
m
wasting
awaywhen
i
was
forced
to
call
the
telephone
company
about
a
bill
concerning
a
disconnected
phone
belonging
to
my
landlord
the
bill
was
four
months
overdue
and
in
the
meanwhile
he
had
been
using
my
phone
,
he
seemed
to
have
no
intention
of
having
his
own
phone
reconnected
i
didn
'
t
visit
a
very
close
friend
at
the
hospital
and
some
days
later
he
diedmy
boat
running
into
another
boat
i
received
a
letter
from
a
distant
friendwhen
,
for
example
,
my
grandfather
fell
seriously
ill
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
operated
and
i
felt
great
fear
of
losing
him
because
he
is
so
dear
to
me
when
i
received
the
acceptance
form
for
the
second
year
at
universitywhen
i
saw
my
name
in
the
newspaper
and
i
knew
that
i
entered
at
the
university
i
told
my
primary
teacher
i
hadn
'
t
done
my
homework
as
my
mother
was
in
a
car
accident
my
teacher
rang
that
night
to
see
how
my
mother
was
she
was
fine
i
e
no
accident
!when
i
stepped
on
a
snake
at
home
,
it
was
dark
but
there
was
moonlight
made
a
statement
that
other
people
did
not
believemy
lovely
girlfriend
double
crossed
me
and
so
that
i
found
her
chatting
with
another
guy
when
my
boss
enrolled
in
a
course
to
satisfy
his
own
ends
to
trample
on
his
associates
i
have
the
misfortune
to
have
one
of
my
superiors
in
my
coursewhen
some
unforgiving
acquaintance
dragged
up
an
old
and
rather
embarassing
situation
from
my
past
one
day
,
when
i
realized
that
i
was
alone
,
i
felt
fear
of
lonelinessmy
grandfather
died
,
i
went
to
the
mortuary
and
saw
the
corpse
at
the
hypocrisy
of
some
of
my
friendswhen
the
result
of
the
certificate
exam
was
announced
i
was
surprised
and
happy
as
the
result
was
better
than
i
had
expected
before
an
exam
in
logicsi
lied
,
to
be
precise
i
cancelled
a
meeting
with
a
good
friend
when
someone
whom
i
considered
my
friend
,
without
telling
me
he
was
annoyed
,
proceeded
to
ignore
me
for
several
meets
with
no
apparent
reasoni
came
across
a
friend
with
whom
i
had
lost
touch
for
a
long
time
i
lived
together
with
my
boyfriend
one
night
he
stayed
away
and
next
day
he
told
me
that
he
had
chat
up
with
another
girlwhen
the
paramilitary
was
sent
to
the
unza
and
it
started
using
tear
gas
and
started
intimidating
the
students
without
any
provocation
insulted
by
other
people
in
the
shopwhen
i
stated
sharply
something
i
was
not
very
sure
of
and
a
few
days
later
i
was
shown
to
be
wrong
i
had
to
have
my
tonsils
out
i
had
been
making
up
my
mind
almost
for
a
year
i
was
afraid
but
during
the
two
hours
in
the
hospital
room
,
while
i
was
waiting
to
be
called
for
the
operation
i
felt
a
real
fear
of
the
pain
,
of
what
they
were
going
to
do
to
me
,
of
the
unknownat
my
summer
job
,
i
was
responsible
for
making
various
orders
it
was
not
me
who
had
ordered
some
seasonal
merchandise
,
but
when
much
of
it
was
left
over
and
had
to
be
thrown
away
in
the
autumn
,
i
felt
partly
responsible
for
the
much
too
large
order
i
feel
disgust
with
my
first
boyfriend
who
made
fun
of
our
love
in
an
abominable
waywhen
i
was
in
form
3
,
my
aunts
lied
to
my
daddy
telling
him
that
i
had
told
them
that
i
was
pregnant
my
daddy
told
my
mother
and
she
asked
me
if
it
was
true
i
was
very
angry
with
my
aunts
tutorial
again
!
a
fearful
feeling
came
to
me
when
i
sat
on
the
chair
and
looked
at
my
fellow
students
all
around
i
was
really
scared
that
they
would
ask
me
some
questions
or
challenge
the
ideas
that
i
had
presentedwhen
i
was
17
,
i
had
a
mystic
vision
i
melted
into
a
dazzling
light
,
which
omitted
perfect
love
the
physical
experience
became
unimportant
,
i
heard
or
saw
the
words
overcome
egotism
the
feeling
of
joy
remained
for
month
after
that
experience
when
two
female
classmates
and
i
were
having
lunch
,
we
chatted
and
cracked
jokes
,
i
was
very
happy
however
,
i
felt
that
i
may
have
said
something
inappropriate
which
might
cause
them
to
have
a
bad
impression
of
memy
father
had
a
heart
attack
when
i
was
not
at
home
(
i
was
still
living
with
them
)
he
recovered
relatively
well
although
he
had
to
retire
(
which
implied
relief
from
the
stress
of
a
small
scale
enterprise
)
i
went
to
the
apartment
of
my
boyfriend
and
saw
some
people
before
his
door
i
thought
that
something
had
happenedi
forgot
to
lock
the
outside
door
at
my
land
lady
'
s
place
when
my
friend
who
was
drunk
insulted
me
in
public
for
no
reason
at
alljealous
of
my
husband
'
s
old
girlfriend
we
met
her
with
her
husband
and
there
was
a
lot
of
reminiscing
i
insulted
the
girl
to
whom
i
had
proposed
when
she
turned
me
downfather
said
if
you
are
pregnant
,
you
will
have
to
procure
abortion
i
was
filled
with
disgust
against
my
father
i
was
to
take
part
in
a
cocktail
party
on
the
occasion
of
our
national
holiday
as
a

about
a

illness
when
i
got
myself

had
been
hunting
for
a
long
timemy
mother
called
me
because
she
had
read
through
the
enveloppe
a
letter
addressed
to
me
she
denied
having
read
it
intentionally
and
said
the
words
just
popped
out
through
the
enveloppe
as
the
sun
was
shining
on
it
hah
hah
i
bought
a
possible
answer
to
a
homework
problem
which
was
completely
inapplicable
to
the
question
due
to
my
not
having
read
about
the
subject

one
individual
takes
advantage
of
and
or
injures
another
relatively
defenseless

spoke
to

in
a
rough
language
i
hung
up
and
heard
someone
walking
outside
our
doorwhen
we
were
in
high
school
a
few
guys
sometimes
provoked
a
friend
of
mine
they
called
her

was
very

approached
me
and
said
hello
when
on

a
fellow
student
crossed
our
way
with
his

realized
that

was
not

sense

guilt

over

,
when

did
not

a
5
years
old
boy

close
to
him
as

before
after
some
time
his
mother
demanded
the
care
of
the

me
through

only
when

went
into

one
way
street
the
car
disappeared
the
rest
of
my
way
home
i
was
very
afraid
your
prejudice
against
psychology
students
and
education
students
(
not
allowing
us
to
go
to
the
medical
university
lectures
)after
the
first
of
may
,
i
detested
my
fiance
'
s
friends
,
who
had
piled
on
to
our
party
and
spoilt
it
completely
when
my
mother
looked
in
my
drawer
(
where
i
keep
my
personal
things
)
and
she
found
some
porno
photos
that
i
have
kept
from
more
than
a
week
,
and
split
itwhen
i
found
out
that
i
could
not
go
to
the
concert
(
after
buying
the
tickets
)
because
of
a
biology
test
which
occurred
the
morning
after
borrowing
a
car
,
and
then
having
a
minor
accident
(
breaking
a
headlight
)as
a
child
about
8
years
old
walking
across
a
paddock
being
set
upon
by
another
boy
who
claimed
it
was
his
land
being
intimidated
by
the
boy
crying
,
being
punched
,
etc
when
i
had
my
childrenwhen
i
got
through
the
first
day
here
at
the
department
housesitting
and
hearing
the
alarm
go
off
i
knew
someone
had
to
be
breaking
in
i
called
the
police
and
was
panicking
while
on
the
phone
it
was
awful
it
turns
out
that
i
stepped
on
the
hidden
alarm
without
prior
knowledge
of
its
existancethe
only
event
i
can
remember
is
having
a
nightmare
when
i
was
very
young
(
3
years
old
)
i
dreamt
about
a
machine
which
was
going
to
crush
me
when
i
was
told
that
the
form
five
results
were
outwhen
at
very
short
notice
i
agreed
to
work
in
place
of
a
friend
who
was
sick
,
and
owner
of
the
restaurant
refused
to
allow
me
a
drink
later
in
the
evening
(
which
is
usually
always
available
for
workers
)
,
did
not
thank
me
,
and
was
generally
indifferent
towards
me
i
felt
i
did
not
deserve
this
receiving
a
postcard
form
my
sweetheart
who
was
abroad
on
vacation
,
not
being
at
all
sure
if
he
would
write
me

when
someone
let
the
air
out

other
city
we
have
gone
steady
for
2
and
1
2
years
and
everything
is
going
very
well
,
but
sometime
this
situation
makes
me
feel
bad
and
very
lonely
once
i
was
not
able
to
give
a
relative
,
who
was
in
a
critical
period
,
a
helping
hand
whenever
i
think
about
it
i
feel
guilty

several
segments
by
something
i
could
not
see
i
suspected
that
it
was
witch
craft
when
i
realized
that

and
that
i
had
a
scleral
tear
in
my
left
eyeone
night

nightafter
a
long
trip
in
my
dad

s
van
without

with
gas
and
dented
the
side
of
the
van
against
the

then
my
cars
electrical
system

me
extremely
happyi
'
ve
always
defended
my
sister
when
needed
,
at
the
expense
of
my
brother
this
has
led
to
feelings
of
guilt
towards
him
when
my
application
for
studying
the
masters
degree
was
acceptedin
a
restaurant
,
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
boy
who
always
told
the
same
things
in
a
very
loud
voice
i
laughed
and
said
to
him
that
he
always
repeated
the
same
things
some
time
later
i
heard
that
he
had
undergone
a
complicated
brain

of
all

born
i
was
travelling
,
we

talking
too
loud
in
the
kitchen

happened
when

timewhen
i
blamed
my
niece

my
book
,
she
denied
having
touched
or
seen
it
but
i
carried
on
insisting
that
it
was
her
my
girlfriend
and
i
slept
in
a
lonely
hut
(
we
had
drunk
alcool
)
suddenly
some
soil
fell
on
us
,
then
some
water
although
we
tried

causei

in
the
countryside
with
several
friends
,
and
we
began
to
eat
figs

full
of
worms

was
working
in

an
immense
sadnesshelping
older
people
on
the
toilet
while

i
invaded
someone
'
s
(
a
girl
'
s
)
personal
space
to
a
large
extentpassing
an
exam
i
did
not
expect
to
pass
i
can
'
t
give
one
description
here
i
often
feel
joyful
when
i
have
done
things
good
in
relation
to
other
people
especially
when
my
friend
says
he
loves
me
and
i
also
tell
him
that
i
love
himwhen
i
was
back
home
after
a
long
time
,
meeting
beloved
people
and
close
friends
i
felt
sad
when
i
was
told
to
walk
out
of
the
classroom
because
i
was
within
the
row
of
students
who
were
making
noisehear
a
very
nice
joke
made
by
a
friend
i
was
disgusted
when
i
was
told
to
dress
a
big
rotten
stinky
wound
which
,
coming
closer
,
made
me
feel
like
vomittingi
was
walking
quite
quickly
and
unthinking
through
a
children
'
s
playground
,
when
a
toddler
ran
in
front
of
me
i
knocked
him
over
and
he
hit
his
head
quite
hard
and
began
crying
i
did
not
go
to
the
exercises
,
without
any
adequate
reasoni
slipped
on
butter
one
evening
in
the
dining
commons
landed
on
my
rear
causing
my
tray
also
to
land
on
the
floor
i
felt
disgust
after
watching
a
picture
on
television
about
torturing
political
prisoners
in
india
(
this
happened
in
the
india
of
indira
ghandi
)i
was
ashamed
of
the
way
i
deceived
that
i
could
not
help
a
friend
,
although
it
was
absolutely
possible
for
me
nothing
was
revealed
but
i
haven
'
t
called
up
this
person
since
then
when
my
room
mate
locked
me
out
deliberately
,
before
an
exam
due
at
1400
hoursi
thought
i
had
taken
a
decision
but
i
hesitated
my
mother
and
father
had
forbidden
me
to
ride
my
scooter
on
the
road
,
and
i
had
transgressed
(
together
with
the
wild
kids
from
across
the
street
)
by
riding
my
scooter
down
a
steep
hill
near
our
house
my
mother
sent
the
boy
next
door
to
collect
me
,
and
i
was
severely
scoldedfinding
out
that
china
is
backward
in
science
this
happened
when
i
went
to
visit
my
friend
in
chelston
and
found
him
screwing
my
girlfriendi
saw
a
movie
called
the
thing
,
the
film
directed
by
john
carpenter
the
monster
in
the
film

me
feel
disgusted
i
answered
a
certain
question
from
dr
maqgda
wrongly
she
asked
something
about
femur
and
my
answer
was
saying
something
concerning
the
brain
so
i
was
very
ashamed
amongst
my
friendsat
an
anti
pornography
meeting
,
when
samples
from
films
and
magazines
were
shown
when
my
husband
talked
about
the
restrictions
he
will
have
to
accept
in
his
life
to
make
our
marriage
work
i
felt
that
it
was
directed
at
me
as
it
was
me
who
had
demanded
the
changes
we
were
with
a
marriage
counsellor
thenwhen
i
crashed
my
car
and
it
had
to
be
scrapped
then
it
was
my
fault
and
i
feel
depressed
as
i
miss
the
car

friend
asked
to
borrow
my
notes
and
i
did
not
give
them
away
(
my
notes
too
badly
written
)tripped
on
a
busy
street
i
felt
that
i
contributed
to
a
possible
rift
in
the
relationship
between
a
boy
and
girl
soon
to
be
married
,
in
my
flat
after
i
moved

at
that
time

back
from

to
find

with
my
boyfriend
,
we
saw
2
people
having
sex
on
the
sand
dunes
in
full
view
of
everyone
it
was
the
fact
that
they
chose
that
area
in
which
to

,
that
disgusted

this
pointless
questionnaire

attacked
me
with
a
knifei

been
guilty
of
gossiping
and
blaming
others

and
one
of
my
superiors
at
the
workplace
made
a
formal
reprimand

because

t

a
mouthful
of
betel
juice
on
the
road

was
very
windy
and
had
i
not
checked
my
speed
i
would
have
had
a
very
good
shower
of
his
saliva
though
i
was
not
angry
,
i
felt
that
these
people
were
very
indecent

disgusted
with
toadies

ignored
me
and
slept
on
a
separate

no
reasons
to
doubt
me
or
to
neglect
me
and
i
had
never
imagined
that
he

do
such
a
thing
when

due
to
the
cold
weatherwhen
i
went
to
the
clinic
for

when
my
ex

t
want

my
boyfriend
that
i
did
not
want
to
go
on
with
our
relationship
i
knew
that
i
was
important
to
him
but
i
wanted
to
be
free
i
saw
that
this
was
difficult
for
him
but
i
remained
firm
and
did
not
change
my
mind
earlier
,
i
was
afraid
of
speaking
in
front
of
a
crowd
of
peoplewhen
my
chief
accused
me
of
an
error
that
i
hadn
'
t
made
i
went
to
the
dining
hall
and
found
that
the
cooks
were
cleaning
the
plates
and
there
was
no
food
for
me
,
and
the
blue
birds
(
security
guards
)
were
busy
eating
the
food
that
was
supposed
to
be
for
meheard
some
postgraduate
students
talking
about
girls
being
unsiutable
to
do
medicine
i
told
my
elder
brother
that
he
was
irresponsible
and
that
i
did
not
care
for
what
he
did
because
he
was
teasing
meat
an
unworthy
behaviour
of
a
man
,
pettiness
,
stupidity
and
mostly
at
a
philistinism
when
a
student
accused
me
of
having
stolen
his
textbook
as
he
had
found
a
form
bearing
my
name
in
his
other
books
and
all
my
explanations
fell
on
deaf
earspromising
someone
to
do
their
job
and
then
not
being
able
to
do
it
due
to
transport
troubles

strange
noise
in

biology
buildingone
day
i
was
walking
with
my
boyfriend

met
my
ex
boyfriend
and
out
of
jealousy
he
started
calling
me
names
at
times
i
have
been
attracted
to
conducts
which
are
socially
degraded
due
to
their
ill
consequences
,
and
then
i
feel
guiltywhen
i
was
selected
at
tiss

a
car
is
overtaking
another

i
am
forced
to

very
sadi

in
my
reason
when
a
close
relative
of
mine
passed
away
,
it
was
the
first
time
that
someone
so
close
to
me
had
diedi
was
at
the
table
at
a
french
friend
'
s
house
they
served
me
a
big
dish
with
roast
cauliflower
and
sauce
i
had
to
eat
it
cannot
remember
such
a
situationwhen
i
failed
an
exam
when
i
do
something
unworthywhen
students
in
our
working
group
showed
no
responsibility
or
interest
in
our
work
when
my
co
resident
opened
the
bathroom
door
while
i
was
bathing
insidein
college
,
i
started
a
discussion
with
the
teacher
referring
to
a
question
i
posed
i
felt
very
unsure
and
i
was
afraid
to
fail
when
i
was
watching
a
movie
with
many
violent
episodes
they
accurately
showed
the
cutting
of
corpses
,
etclast
year
i
had
a
friend
visiting
me
for
several
days
the
only
thing
he
did
was
sleeping
,
drinking
,
taking
pills
and
thinking
only
about
himself
i
got
a
very
nasty
electrical
shock
when
i
was

applainceswaking
up
from

stronger
when
my
father
diedwhen
i
could
not
pass
my
exams
with
good
marks
my
wedding
was
to
take
place
15
days
after

i
tried
to
convince
myself
that
this
was
the
reason
for
my
not
having
done
well
however
,
i
thought
that
had
i
really
put
my
mind
to
doing
well
at
the
exams
i
would
have
done
well
i
came
home

when

myself
by
vomitting
all
over
the
place
and
insulting
the
people
who
were
there
with
meat
using
other
people
,
because
of

was
using

her
down
at
my
grandmother

s
detestable
and
selfish
conduct
towards
my

to
change

clothes
for
the
first
time

unexpectedly
at
the
age

53
years
he

angry
when

had
not
been
granted
a
leave
out

during
the
last
weekend

met
three
drunk
boys
,
almost
children

gave
me
lower

beat
up
a
female

she
had
been
telling

later
called
to
explain
my
behaviouras

small
boy
,
i
took
a
coin
from
an
empty
taxi

mother
saw
it

told
the

her
that

when
i
actually
did
not

take

is
very
difficult
to
relate
it
to
a
certain
event
i
am
familiar
with
the
disgust
of
sartre
(

nauste
)
,
a
frequently
occurring
cause
may
be
described
as
the
self
assured
dullness
when
i
think
about
the
short
time
that
we
live
and
relate
it
to
the
periods
of
my
life
when
i
think
that
i
did
not
use
this
short
timewhen
i
was
working
,
i
got
treated
in
a
way
which
i
felt
was
not
democratic

owni
would
have
liked
to
go
out
to

with
some
acquaintances
,

unfortunately

lost

when
i
understood
i
was
admitted
to
the
sofia
universitywhen
i
heard
of
the
death
of
a
friend
who
had
just
finished
her
training
i
felt
very
sad
for
she
was
young
when
i
told
a
girl
that
i
could
not
take
her
out
that
night
as
i
was
entertaining
my
mother
who
had
come
from
home
however
,
i
later
met
this
girl
with
another
girlfriend
at
a
hostel
where
i
had
taken
out
another
girlfriend
of
minemy
parents
and
brother
came
up
over
the
weekend
we
are
a
very
close
family
this
was
my
first
year
away
from
home
they
brought
one
jacko
lantern
with
a
new
design
that
is
the
old
joke
that
we
have
a
great
new
design
it
'
s
always
the
same
no
responseafter
hearing
about
the
death
of
my
grandfather
first
i
could
not
believe
it
,
but
later
i
wept
and
felt
the
situation
was
hopeless
i
felt
lonely
and
wanted
to
be
consolated
my
friend
half
teasingly
called
me
a
bad
nickname
i
felt
insulted
and
kicked
his
hip
in
anger
i
was
stable
later
and
did
not
feel
angry
at
him
in
fact
i
was
afraid
that
the
other
friends
who
were
with
us
would
think
that
i
was
an
intolerant
person
however
i
could
not
apologize
,
so
i
pretended
that
nothing
had
happened
and
smiled
when
i
left
my
friend
did
not
say
anything
but
just
watched
me
leavewhen
my
exboyfriend
threw
me
around
the
dorms
because
i
was
talking
on
the
phone
to
another
guy
of
whom
he
was
jealous
,
after
we
had
an
argument
in
which
i
thought
we
broke
up
broken
a
friend

s
cupi
call
my
mother
at
least
once
a
week
however
last
week
i
completely
forgot
this
morning
she
called
me
,
she
thought
i
felt
ill
i
have
never
felt
this
emotionwhen
i
was
taking
my
girlfriend
out
,
she
seemed
to
have
taken
her
time
i
once
stole
my
father
'
s
money
and
denied
having
done
it
instead
father
threatened
my
young
brother
and
he
was
beaten
he
was
innocent
and
i
felt
guiltywhen
criticizing
something
about
a
person
and
then
realizing
that
the
person
whom
one
is
talking
to
is
similar
i
was
very
glad
when
i
learned
i
was
a
student
already
i
heard
about
it
over
the
phone
,
i
didn
'
t
believe
it
at
firstbeing
treated
unfairly
when
my
elder
sister
had
a
baby
girl
she
was
the
first
girl
in
the
family
after
19
years
of
baby
boyswhen
i
learnt
that
my
cousin

good
mark

a
subject

had
worked
hard
at
but
expected
only
a
moderate
marki
went
to
visit
a
friend
in
hospital
he
was
going
to
be
operated
the
next
day
i
was
afraid
that
they
would
not
let
me
in
and
i
did
not
know
what
his
reaction
would
be
on
seeing
me
one
saturday
night
i
did
some
meaningless
work
and
went
to
bed
very
late
next
morning
i
had
was
very
sleepy
so
i
continued
sleeping
even
though
i
had
work
to
do
and
i
missed
the
sunday
servicei

ashamed

receiving
personal
criticisms
early
in

rubbish
bin
and
eat
iti
had
this
feeling
before
my
graduation
and
never
dared
to
speak
to
my
relatives
and
friends
because
of
this
feeling
i
would
avoid
situations
,
however
i
do
not
know
the
reason
for
this
i
had
made
an
appointment
with
three

had
to
go
out
together
when
i
arrived
at
the
place
,
the
other
persons
weren
'
t
there
i
became
very
angry
because
i
thought
they
were
gone
without
me
that
,
however
,
didn
'
t
appear
to
be
the
casei
felt
ashamed
to
be
brazilian
and
to
live
under
a
military
dictatorship
that
despoiled
the
people
,
when
during
my
military
service
the
death
of

driving
very
fast
on
a
small
road
and
i
met
an
oncoming
car
in
a
right
handed
bend
the
other
driver
was
on
his
own
side
of
the
road
and
i
had
to
skid
out
of
it
to
avoid
a
collision
it
was
dark
there
was
a
time
when
my
room
looked
terribly
untidy
just
at
that
time
my
aunt
came
to
see
me
fortunately
i
could
prevent
her
from
entering
the
roomi
experience
that
feeling
when
i
am
unsulted
without
deserving
it
or
when
someone
deceives
me
when
i
won
the
best
prize
in
the
national
science

selected

not
have
the

venous
blood
from
another
patient

introduced
air
into
the
place
of
puncturing

there
was
a
swelling
which
is
dangerous
to
the
patient

became
afraid

a
very
good
friend

year
after
our
graduation

prepared
to
celebrate
her

and
to

when
i
went
to
ask
for
help
to
my
sister
,
my
mother

that
i
was
proud
,
that
i
asked

that
i

'
t
able

'
s
death
i
was
nearly
knocked
down
while
i
was
cyclingon
my
birthday
when
several
good
friends
came
to
visit
me

people
talking
about

and
saying
that

am
stupidi
was
an
instructior
in
a
youth
organization
whenever
we
,
the
instructors
would
have
a
meeting
the
advisor
would
be
present
he
did
not
understand
our
worknig
conditions
but
talked
a
lot
and
had
a
lot
of
outdated
ideas
whenever
we
disagreed
with
him
he
was
very
discontent
and
said
that
we
had
a
prejudice
against
him
why
did
he
have
to
treat
us
as
his
subordinates
?
got
a
present
from
my
friend
for
my
birthdayi
was
afraid
when
my
first
boyfriend
threatened
to
make
an
end
to
our
relationship
because
he
didn
'
t
love
me
enough
while
i
loved
him
very
much
the
way
this
particular
girl
spoke
,
behaved
,
and
reacted
the
first
time
i
was
introduced
to
her
,
i
felt
certain
that
something
between
us
would
materializewhen
we
were
at
home
,
my
husband
and
i
,
he
made
a
remark
about
something
i
had
done
,
in
a
perfectly
friendly
manner
my
deed
had
been
unjust
and
i
knew
that
my
husband
was
right
,
therefore
my
sense
of
shame
i
felt
disgust
with
a
lady
teacher
who
used
to
nag
,
to
mock
,
to
interrupt
everyone
of
my
fellow
students
each
time
we
had
a
class
with
her
in
our
first
yearwhen
my
boss
cut
off
my
vacations
saying
that
in
that
month
it
wouldn
'
t
be
possible
,
and
after
some
time
he
let
another
girl
take
vacations
that
month
the
anger
was
because
of
the
resentment
resulting
from
our
bad
relationship
when
i
talked
to
another
student
about
the
notes
she
got
last
semester
,
not
knowing
that
she
got
a
lot
of
bad
gradeswhen
i
wasn
'
t
well
prepared
for
a
terminal
exam
and
the
teacher
tried
to
give
me
a
three
by
asking
me
some
very
easy
questions
i
burned
with
shame
then
one
day
,
i
was
home
and
there
was
a
phone
call
informing
me
that
some
of
my
relatives
had
died
in
an
accidentclass
leader
getting
me
to
do
things
he
did
not
want
to
do
in
school
i
had
difficulties
mith
mathematics
when
i
had
to
work
for
an
examination
,
i
really
felt
disgustedwas
threatened
with
a
knife
in
the
military
by
soldiers
form
another
unit
the
reason
was
girls
one
day
i
took
my
playmates
to
the
river
to
swim
and
play
one
of
them
was
epileptic
so
he
drowned
into
the
water
i
felt
guilty
because
it
was
me
who
took
them
therewhen
my
younger
sister
visited
me
during
the
school
holidays
and
told
me
that
she
would
not
go
back
to
school
because
she
was
pregnant
the
same
event
described
under
fear
in
the
bus
a
man
sat
beside
me
,
with
his
trousers
open
and
holding
his
penisi
blew
up
at
someone
for
being
confused
and
because
of
his
irresponsibility
and
afterwards
i
felt
guilty
and
that
i
had
no
right
i
went
to
eat
at
my
aunt
'
s
house
and
she
served
macaroni
with
a
horrible
appearence
i
felt
the
sensation
above
the
worst
was
that
i
was
practically
obliged
to
eatin
autumn
i
had
to
move
to
another
lodging
my
landlords
,
quite
intelligent
people
,
warned
me
i
had
to
move
in
the
nearest
future
but
i
had
difficulties
in
moving
my
luggage
because
i
couldn
'
t
wait
for
a
car
to
come
how
amazed
i
was
to
hear
them
threatening
me
they
would
throw
our
my
things
and
at
that
my
luggage
was
well
packed
and
did
not
stand
in
their
way
i
was
quite
disappointed
and
disgusted
when
a
certain
boy
went
about
saying
that
i
am
his
girlfriend
i
wrote
him
an
insulting
letter
to
him
and
called
him
namesi
was
walking
in

came
across
two
dogs
who
began
barking
at
me
i
did
not
know
whether
they
were
tied
up
or
loose
,
but
i
was
afraid
of
them
approaching
me
when
i
was
4
,
we
spent
our
holidays
at
the
seaside
my
sister
and
her
friend
wanted
to
go
to
a
bay
on
an
undangerous
way
i
wanted
to
arrive
before
them
and
went
on
a
shorter
,
but
more
dangerous
way
when
i
arrived
,
i
found
nobody
there
i
waited
for
a
long
time
,
but
nobody
came
on
my
way
back
i
met
my
mother
who
had
been
searching
for
me
desperatly
she
did
not
scold
me
,
but
i
saw
how
much
she
had
worried
(
herself
)mentioning
a
book
to
the
person
who
borrowed
it
finding
out
that
china
is

and
i
felt
guilty
after
sometimesome
time
ago
we
had
a
tournament
in
our
tennis
club
for
tactical
reasons
i
was
chosen
to
play
against
a
much
weaker
player
than
i
am
although
it
would
have
been
enough
simply
to
win
the
game
,
i
defeated
him
extremely
this
would
not
have
been
necessary
a
sudden
doubt
made
me
run
for
a
long
time
in
a
rainy
autumn
night
when
i
reached
the
intended
place
i
saw
my
beloved
in
another
man
'
s
arms
a
sudden
blow
,
grief
,
i
cannot
qualify
it
,
it
is
painful
for
me
to
remember
about
iton
the
tv
news
i
heard
that
nicaragua
had
complained
about
the
increasing
threat
of
war
with
the
usa
once
i
was
not
ready
for
a
seminar
and
i
was
asked
to
leavei
felt
it
at
the
same
time
when
i
felt
disgust
when
i
got
admission
in
m
sc
(
i
)
organic
chemistry
,
i
was
very
happywhen
i
try
to
lie
i
studied
medicine
for
several
semesters
and
at
that
time
i
developed
a
great
fear
of
examinations
i
was
most
afraid
of
my
examination
of
anatomy
while
other
students
were
examined
,
i
was
dissecting
i
was
able
to
hear
everything
and
was
waiting
with
fear
until
it
was
my
turnwhenever
i
am
late
,
i
feel
ashamed
of
myself
even
though
no
one
tells
me
anything
my
friend
had
trouble
and
i
was
not
able
to
help
himwhen
a
close
friend
wilfully
cheated
me
when
i
won
some
coins
in
a
small
competionlistening
to
horrot
stories
at
night
when
i
broke
a
tea
saucer
i
felt
ashamed
this
was
during
the
birthday
of
my
girlfriendwhen
i
discovered
my
mother
had
been
having
an
affair
with
my
father
'
s
best
friend
,
and
then
ran
away
with
him
without
even
speaking
to
me
about
what
she
was
doing
letting
me
come
home
from
school
simply
to
find
her
gone
i
was
filled
with
disgust
and
contempt
when
i
failed
my
first
biochemistry
testi
was
with
a
girl
one
night
and
then
did
not
call
her
again
,
although
she
had
asked
me
to
do
so
after
masturbationi
forgot
to
zip
up
my
trousers
,
this
was
not
noticed
by
anyone
i
was
very
sad
when
i
was
shouted
at
by
uncle
and
was
told
that
i
was
not
to
be
given
school
fees
because
i
didn
'
t
go
to
work
in
the
garden
since
i
had
gone
to
escort
my
sister
to
the
bus
depotwhen
i
bought
new
clothes
and
put
them
on
watching
an
alcoholic
woman
who
was
approaching
everyone
at
the
wharf
for
cigarettes
a
prostitute
in
auckland
(
elderly
)the
girl
i
was
seeing
didn
'
t
want
to
have
a
serious

at
an
elegant
restaurant
and
i
did
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
the
bill
there
were
a
lot
of
people
there
and
i
felt
quite
awkwardwhen
i
have
to
go
in
for
an
exam
and
the
examinor
is
a
person
with
a
whimsical
character
and
unsteady
requirements
a
certain
friend
evokes
positive
feelings
,
when
i
am
with
him
but
negative
feelings
when
he
is
not
present
i
feel
the
need
to
express
those
negative
feelings
however
,
when
i
speak
about
him
,
i
always
think
why
do
i
like
this
,
he
does
not
deserve
this
,
but
still
i
do
soafter
moving
out
of
my
apt
i
took
all
the
furniture
and
dishes
and
everything

was
mine

i
took
it
all
just
to
spite
my
roomies
we
had
a
few
(
a
lot
)
of
disagreements
i
felt
guilt
for
moving
out
for
the
bad
reasons

workmate
and
i
had
been
antagonistic
with
each
other
for
some
weeks

violently
to
my
criticisms
of
his
work
standardsthat
afternoon

i

which
went
overdue
my

charged
for
the
delay

day
,
i
was
alone
on
duty
when
a
patient
choked
while
eating
i
ran

but
it

late
one
night
going
downstairs
,
and
hearing
a
strong
stirring
of
brances
,
which

not
the
windat
my
father
,
when
he
yelled
and
accused
my
sister
'
s
friend
(
over
the
phone
)
of
doing
something
he
didn
'
t
do
,
or
know
anything
about
this
happened
a
year
when
i
was
having
a
hard
time
,
i
got
admission
to
do
research
despite
obstacles
in
the
procedure
of
admissioni
was
very
disgusted
the
first
day
i
went
to
put
a
dead
body
in
the
mortuary
there
were
many
dead
bodies
and
some
were
uncovered
so
we
had
to
put
on
top
of
the
other
bodies
six
months
ago
when
i
got
acquaintanced
with
a
person
whom
i
trusted
infinitely
and
from
whom
i
expected
help
and
friendly
feelings
with
him
i
found
much
in
common
in
our
views
and
in
our
fatei
felt
joy
when
i
heard
my
name
being
called
on
the
radio
as
one
of
the
students
who
had
passed
the
interview
of
nursing
and
was
selected
to
start
nursing
my
mother
and
her
friends
were
speaking
badly
about
my
father
when
they
were
separated
,
and
my
brothers
and
sisters
and
myself
were
allowed
to
listeni
was
sitting
in
a
restaurant
with
friends
and
i
knew
that
in
the
meantime
my
girl
friend
must
have
come
to
my
flat
and
found
the
door
closed
when
one
of
my
closest
friends
failed
to
make
it
to
the
third
year
of
universityi
was
watching
a
movie
alone
it
was
a
horror
movie
the
music
was
a
deep
pulsing
type
not
really
music
and
a
light
flashed
on
and
off
it
was
in
the
complete
darkness
of
a
movie
theatre
that
was
almost
empty
when
i
came
back
from
my
holidaysmy
article
not
chosen
by
the
college
newspaper
my
behaviour
at
a
recent
party
i
passed
out
early
,
luckilymy
roommate
liked
to
listen
to
some
meaningless
songs
which
had
melody
but
had
no
content
we
lived
together
so
when
he
played
the
recorder
i
was
forced
to
listen
to
them
i
could
not
tell
him
that
i
did
not
like
to
listen
to
the
songs
,
as
i
had
no
right
to
disturb
the
freedom
of
others
so
i
would
find
a
pretext
to
leave
the
room
and
go
somewhere
else
i
had
been
very
weary
all
week
no
letters
,
no
phonecalls
,
no
visitors
and
then
my
younger
sister
came
with
some
cheese
,
a
card
and
some
pocket
money
for
me
and
she
told
me
that
she
was
working
nowan
old
woman
was
violently
thrown
down
the
stairs
of
the
tube
by
a
group
of
louts
in
arguments
with
a
close
friend
or
relative
where
my
point
of
view
is
completely
disregardedno
response
in
the
bus
i
was
sitting
next
to
a
colleage
who
was
drunk
and
behaved
in
keeping
with
his
statea
colleague
asked
me
for
some
advice
and
as
he
did
not
have
enough
confidence
in
me
he
asked
a
third
person
my
mother
was
always
fastidious
about
my
room
,
bed
time
,
etc
she
treated
us
strictly
and
punished
us
physically
these
things
were
intolerablewhen
my
grandmother
died
of
cancer
when
i
saw
a
lot
of
rubbish
and
animal
waste
on
the
flooronce
i
quarrelled
with
my
sister
and
after
this
i
deliberately
messed
up
her
belongings

of
hard
work
and
having
suffered

changes

friend
switched
over
to
the
other
cannel
without
asking
me
what
i
wanted
when
i
had
to
leave
my
mother
and
my
sister
after
a
week
'
s
visitwhen
i
quarrelled
with
my
boyfriend
when
i
realized
that
it
did
not
make
much
sense
to
start
a
relationship
with
a
girl
who
was
not
very
constructive
to
establish
a
firm
relationshipfor
the
girl
who
halped
me

on

and
made
me
happy
when
i
don

see
her
even
for
two
or
three
days
deceived
by
other
people

ran
into
troublealways
when

so
i
called

guilty
at
being

guilty
at
being

about
being
a
potential
success
in
various
areas
of
society
(
so
stupid
this
emotion
)
someone
ruining
someone
'
s
property
just
for
the
fun
of

that
i

was
in
bombay
one
of
my
good
friends
was
getting
married
and
he
had
not
informed
me
about
it
,
this
made
me
sad
i
am
chosen
for
the
english

instead
of
my
good
friend
and
people
told
me
that
girls
are
more
likely
to

choseni
found
some
worms
in

food
and
i
had
obviously
eaten
some

failed
to
answer
a
simple
questioni
thought
i
would
be
able
to
use
the
mangle
of
the
house
,
and
so
i
did
not
want
any
help
however
,
i
blocked
it
and
i
had
to
get
the
janitor
to
help
me
out
he
reproached
me
for
not
having
followed
the
instructions
when
i
patronized
a
certain
tavern
which
had
prostitutes
,
it
was
almost
a
brothelsleeping
alone
in
a
tent
,
while
hearing
several
noises
such
as
rustling
etc
,
i
am
afraid
that
there
are
people
who
are
up
to
no
good
when
the
cast

election
resulted
in
norway

a
conservative

guilty
and
wished

had
done
more
i
went
to

with
a
girl
and
the
next
day
she
thought
it
was
the
start
of
something
serious
and
i
just
thought
it
was
fun
and
i
told
her
i
wasn

interested
in

a
serious
relationshipwhen
i
was
at
s
y
bajaj
i
wanted
to

day
i
had
an
appointment
with
my
boyfriend
which
i
had
objected
to

break
into
his
housewhen
my
father
(
physically
handicapped
)
asks
me
to
do
something
and
i
raise
several
objections
often
i
can
fix

in
few
moments
when
my
uncle
found

intercourse
with
a
distant
relative
of
mine
in

sitting
room
,
on

to
make
an
end
to
our
relationshipa
friend

when

when
anybody
wants
to
make
me

guilty
for

should
do
something
for
my
mother
,
but
things
didn
'
t

fear
when
one
night
my
aunt
and

alone
at

house
to
look
after
the
baby
when
they
went
to

things
to
heri
had
promised
to
call
a
girl
but
i
did
not
do
it
when
my
gradmother
died
i
felt
very
sad
then
the
feeling
started
to
be
worse
after
a
whilewhen
i
thought
for
an
instant
that
a
very
good
relationship
with
a
person
had
finished
when
i
reproached
my
friend
because
i
was
myself
low
spirited
and
disappointedat
primary
school
i
was
accused
by
some
boys
of
being
in
love
with
a
certain
girl
in
their
class
so
they
had
to
shout
and
beat
the
girl
and
the
matter
was
reported
to
the
headmaster
during
a
ski
tour
with
a
friend
,
we
two
had
drunk
too
much
when
we
went
down
the
slope
on
ski
,
i
lost
my
friend
who
had
lost
his
way
i
thought
that
something
must
have
happened
to
him
(
he
finally
arrived
but
after
a
very
long
time
)i
failed
a
subject
despite
the
fact
that
i
had
studied
quite
a
lot
for
it
watching
an
old
lady
running
up
the
street
to
catch
her
bus
and
miss
it
,
it
reminded
me
of
my
own
mother
and
how
dreadful
it
would
be
to
be
her
in
the
same
situationwhen
i
saw
all
the
very
drunk
kids
(
13
14
years
old
)
in
town
on
walpurgis
night
when
i
was
denied
my
favourite
dish
at
the
dinning
hall
(
shima
with
roast
chicken
)
,
i
felt
disgustedin
a
dark
street
at
4
o
'
clock
in
the
night
and
there
was
complete
silence
when
my
dad
told
me
about
something
he
had
done
against
my
motherone
evening
when
a
boy
who
was
drunk
made
a
pass
at
me
by
trying
to
kiss
me
sometimes
when
i
go
to
work
my
crazy
boss
(
a
hyper
jewish
lawyer
)
insists
i
do
things
his
way
(
filing
,
typing
,
etc
)
he
sometimes
blames
me
for
things
i
didn
'
t
do
,
and
i
can
'
t
yell
back
at
himwhen
i
found
my
boyfriend
,
who
i
had
been
dating
for
a
year
,
at
another
girl
'
s
house
we
had
had
previous
conflicts
concerning
the
girl
,
but
he
had
always
claimed
they
were
just
friends
when
i
was
accepted
as
supervisor
for
a
student
teacher
the
notification
came
by
postwhen
i
got
in
jungle
where
there
was
a
great
number
of
snakes
my
sister
lost
one
of
her
twin
sons
(
my
first
nephews
)
and
then
the
older
one
died
a
week
laterthe
emotion
came
when
a
certain
boy
opened
my
locker
without
my
knowledge
i
was
walking
along
the
passage
to
my
room
(
very
near
the
anatomy
laboratory
)
and
i
heard
something
and
felt
that
there
was
some
thing
behind
me
i
looked
back
and
there
was
no
one
i
started
imagining
that
maybe
it
was
a
corpseon
december
the
28th
i
was
filled
with
joy
when
i
was
told
by
my
bosses
that
i
had
been
selected
to
attend
a
course
at
the
lilongwe
school
for
health
scienced
in
lilongwe
when
i
recently
got
a
very
positive
answer
from
a
clinic
telling
me
that
they
would
willingly
assist
and
collect
data
for
me
for
a
clinical
pilot
studysome
time
ago
i
promised
to
meet
an
acquaintance
of
mine
and
to
carry
him
some
promised
papers
i
haven
'
t
done
it
until
this
day
now
i
feel
quite
awkward
when
i
meet
him
my
mother
left
my
father
for
his
best
friend
,
and
he
moved
to
papua
new
guinea
despite
the
fact
that
i
am
closer
to
my
father
than
to
anyone
else
in
my
family
,
i
had
to
move
in
with
my
mother
,
and
say
good
bye
to
my
father
,
not
knowing
when
i
would
see
him
againthe
price
i
was
charged
for
work
on
my
car
after
an
argument
with
a
friend
of
minewhen
i
was
victimized
for
running
away
with
a
girl
who
was
somebody
else
'
s
wife
and
niece
at
the
same
time
i
was
very
angry
over
this
issue
because
i
was
told
to
pay
him
money
after
having
been
punished
for
it
when
i
learnt
that
i
had
been
betrayed
by
my
frienda
very
good
friend
of
mine
had
been
away
for
three
months
when
we
met
again
,
we
ran
up
to
each
other
and
embraced
sleeping
with
a
girl
on
a
saturday
night
and
then
not
contacting
her
in
later
dayswhile
walking
through
an
old
mining
area
,
i
unwittingly
disturbed
a
wallaby
which
,
in
its
resultant
flight
,
accidentally
fell
down
a
deep
mine
shaft
on
investigation
it
seemed
uninjured
,
but
it
was
impossible
for
the
wallaby
to
get
out
,
and
also
for
me
to
get
it
out
of
the
shaft
to
prevent
its
suffering
a
slow
death
,
i
shot
it
i
asked
someone
to
go
out
and
she
accepted
right
awaywhen
i
act
thinking
that
i
know
everything
and
i
then
realize
that
there
were
things
i
had
not
thought
about
,
thus
hurting
others
when
i
get
an
exam
back
with
a
grade
that
i
did
not
desire
then
i
get
mad
at
myself
and
say
that
i
could
have
done
betterduring
an
argument
with
my
brother
,
i
behaved
rather
intransigently
,
even
cruelly
,
wishing
to
morally
hurt
the
person
opposed
to
me
being
subject
to
unfair
treatment
in
a
working
group
,
someone
bending
the
rules
was
protected
by
the
boss
this
resulted
in
more
work
for
the
othersi
am
left
handed
when
i
attended
the
first
form
,
we
learned
to
write
with
pens
i
smeared
everything
i
had
written
all
my
friends
had
written
well
and
wanted
to
know
why
the
teacher
was
looking
at
my
note
book
i
was
ashamed
talking
about
a
person

and
anxious

day
before

him
hard

to
visit
his

to
someone
to
get
info
for
a
paper
i
was
writing
i
told
her
that
the
info
was
for
a
newspaper
article
i
was
afraid
if
i
told
the
truth
she
wouldn
'
t
help
me
a
friend
of
mine
trusted
me
to
back
her
in
a
decision
she
had
made
but
when
the
moment
came
i
did
not
agree
with
her
opinionin
a
mathematics
class
,
the
professor
asked
me
a
question
and
i
gave
the
wrong
answer
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
it
,
i
quarelled
with
my
boyfriend
who
was
trying
to
be
especially
kind
to
megetting
slightly
intoxicated

had
to

time

the
head
prefect
came
and

very
angry
as
there
were
other
prefects
sitting
and

picked
on

maltreated
physically

to
put

while
in

suddenly
something

sharply
in
front
of
me
and
i
was
not
able
to
see
what
it
washaving
a
car
accident
when
someone
is
accused
or
punished
instead
of
mei
am
a
school
teacher
at
a
teacher
parent
meeting
i
received
a
good
deal
of
positive
feed
back
on
my
work
both
from
the
parents
and
through
them
from
the
pupils
when
i
received
my
u
e
accredited
as
i
was
totally
unexpecting
it
and
i
was
so
happyi
felt
a
great
joy
when
i
knew
that
my
father
was
going
to
sell
the
apartment
from
guarusa
,
because
in
some
way
we
were
helded
by
it
,
that
means
that
we
didn
'
t
go
to
any
other
place
,
because
we
had
the
apartment
once
i
was
alone
at
home
i
suddenly
felt
unwell
and
there
was
no
one
to
help
me
and
call
first
aidwhen
,
after
having
cleaned
up
the
kitchen
,
two
hours
later
i
saw
that
there
was
a
big
mess
it
irritated
me
very
much
once
my
father
slapped
my
mother
for
a
small
quarreli
went
to
visit
montrose
home
for
crippled
children
to
interview
a
handicapped
child
i
interviewed
two
boys
and
it
went
really
well
i
promised
i
would
visit
them
,
but
never
got
the
time
now
i
hope
they
'
ve
forgotten
me
,
but
i
feel
ashamed
of
letting
them
down
when
i
was
the
target
of
a
great
many
insults
and
completely
unfair
accusations
of
a
large
group
of
peoplei
was
filled
with
joy
when
i
heard
that
i
had
passed
my
secondary
school
leaving
certificate
exam
one
evening
i
was
watching
the
news
on
tv
again
they
were
talking
about
the
danger
of
war
suddenly
i
imagined
what
it
might
mean
for
me
,
for
my
friends
,
for
the
people
close
to
me
i
felt
it
a
very
near
and
possible
eventwhen
i
finished
the
work
that
i
had
planned
to
do
my
homework
when
my
boyfriend
wouldn
'
t
dance
with
me
on

graduation
night

thought
i
could
dance
with
my
friends
who
were
friendlyfinding
out
my
grades
at
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year

think
that
the
only
time
i
really
felt
shame
was
when
i
was
very
young
and
i
had
to
defecate
on
the
street
i
was
very
worried
in
case
someone
should
see

myself
at
a
first

when
my
nephew
was
born
the

a
big
babywhen
i
passed
my
msce

was
selected
to
go

was
talking
to
a
friend

he
said
something

was
very
funnya
friend

to
come
with
me
to
the

he
didn
'
t
come

boy
who
shot

squirrelit

necessary
to
organise
a

with
a
celebration
everyone
was
to
be
present
at
that
event
it
turned
out
that
there
was
no
audience
at
all
because
everyone
had
pretended
to
be
very
intelligent
and
no
one
had
come
i
got
furious
one
of
these
people
who
sell
meat
in

a
knife
to
stab
his
friend
and
later
carried
on

and
sharp
wordsafter

down
to

of
mine
called
me
when
i
was
not
at

i
phoned
her
back
to
know
what
she
wanted
and
she
told
me
that
she
had
dialled
the
wrong
number
one
day
i
was
near
home
,
kissing
my
boyfriend
in
a
car

lot
of
friends
in
the
middle
of
the
street
at
day
brake
every
time
,
in
the
last
few
days
,
when

close
to
my
girlfriend

he
managed
to
win
the
sympathy
of
as
many
people
as
possible
he
said
he
first
listened
to
what
they
said
and
then
he
tried
to
only
say
things
they
would
like
to
hear
he
would
never
express
his
own
opinion
i
felt
really
disgusted
when
he
told
that
i
was
cold
to
my
sister
without
meaning
it
,
just
because
i
was
upset
and
frustatedi
don
'
t
know
why
suddenly
i
thought
that
what
i
was
feeling
for
my
boyfriend
was
not
really
love
after
almost
three
years
being
together
,
this
matter
of
fact
shaked
me
and
i
felt
a
great
sorrow
that
i
can
call
sadness
while
travelling
in
a
bus
,
there
were
three
people
sitting
behind
me
(
two
men
and
a
woman
)
they
were
drunk
and
the
conversation
was
unbelievable
(
about
fucking
,
fellatio
,
etc
)
they
tried
to
get
others
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
i
loathed
it
and
felt
like
cryingi
arrived
in
vienna
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
asked
for
some
silly
information
as
i
realized
myself
afterwards
and
the
inquiry
clerk
reacted
in
a
very
arrogant
manner
when
i
had
exams
a
relative
of
ours
,
who
lives
in
another
city
,
came
to
visit
us
and
i
felt
disgusted
at
himthe
weekend
after
i
argued
with
my
parents
i
went
home
again
and
they
couldn
'
t
have
been
nicer
as
soon
as
i
walked
in
,
mum
kissed
me
,
then
dad
,
and
thanked
me
for
the
birthday
presents
i
'
d
left
for
him
,
including
a
very
sentimental
birthday
card
when
i
finished
my
exams
after
12th
grade
,
i
was
worried
about
getting
a
t
e
score
high
enough
for
physiotherapy
when
i
found
that
i
had
been
accepted
i
was
ecstatic
,
or
more
appropriately
,
could
jump
for
joywhen
i
was
7
8
years
old
,
i
woke
up
one
night
and
found
myself
alone
at
home
my
mother
had
gone
out
to
buy
cigarattes
from
a
machine
one
day
in
the
intimity
with
my
girlfriend
i
had
an
ejaculationwhen
a
good
friend
of
mine
behaved
in
a
very
cool
manner
to
me
for
a
very
long
time
when
i
was
confronted
by
a
policeman
one
night
around
11
o
'
clock
i
was
afraid
when
they
threatened
to
take
me
and
my
girl
to
the
gallowswhen
two
of
my
children
were
critically
ill
with
measles
i
felt
sad
when
my
father
was
sickat
my
summer
job
a
new
caretaker
had
been
employed
who
was
my
age
but
i
preferred
going
out
for
lunch
with
the
accounts
personnel
rather
than
with
him
on
my
way
to
a
concert
i
went
with
a
man
who
tried
to
molest
me
at
that
moment
i
did
not
care
much
but
now
the
impression
fills
me
with
disgusti
felt
the
emotion
when
i
fought
somebody
who
was
drunk
and
tried
to
disturb
us
while
we
were
having
meals
i
saw
in
the
street
a
man
spittingi
was
camping
in
an
old
broken
hut
which
had
no
lights
i
had
brought
along
a
lamp
which
was
not
working
very
well
the
door
made
strange
sounds
and
i
was
sure
that
strange
things
were
happening
the
most
terrifying
bit
was
that
there
were
many
wardrobes
in
the
hut
and
everytime
that
i
looked
in
the
glass
of
the
wardrobe
i
felt
that
there
were
objects
behind
me
the
whole
night
was
spent
in
fear
and
restlessness
i
was
so
excited
once
that
i
told
my
classmate
that
she
was
old
,
this
hurt
her
and
i
felt
guiltywhen
i
was
taken
to
the
place
where
my
uncle
had
defecated
in
his
pants
after
having
drunk
beer
spoilt
,
smashed
and
molded
potatoes
in
the
fridge
,
and
having
to
clean
up
the
dish
lateri
had
to
take
care
of
the
plants
of
a
friend
of
mine
for
several
weeks
i
watered
them
,
but
let
them
stand
in
a
cold
room
so
that
two
of
them
perished
i
was
ashamed
when
my
classmates
discovered
that
i
fell
in
love
with
an
uneducated
girli
took
my
grandmother
'
s
money
without
telling
her
and
when
asked
if
it
was
me
who
had
taken
the
money
,
i
denied
it
i
went
shopping
with
my
parents
my
father

)
when

if

,
sitting
in

,
asked

a
few
questions
and
i
did
not

in
a
park
when
a
group
of
people
began
throwing
sticks
at

no
reason

than
the
satisfaction
of

felt
it
when
playing
i
pushed
my
brother
and
he
fell
down
cutting
himself
in
pieces
of
tile

felt
guilty
one
day
when

of
running
away
from

and
i
was
caughti

really
angry
when
the

back
from
school
i
found
that
she
had
not
cleaned

since
i
had
to
cook

unhappy
and
disgusted
when
i
saw
that
i
had
passed
an
exam
it
was
the
last
chance
and
there
was
a
lot
at
stakei
am
disgusted
by
people
who
spoil
their
identity
because
of
misbehaviour
this
morning
when
i
was
in
a
crowded
bus
,
i
found
a
seat
on
which
a
university
student
was
sitting
on
one
side
and
he
had
put
his
bag
and
files
next
to
him
there
was
very
little
space
left
and
i
sat
down
while
he
kept
on
reading
even
when
i
leaned
on
him
he
did
not
put
his
bag
away
he
did
not
respond
and
i
felt
very
angry
when
i
was
at
school
,
no
one
thought
i
could
pass
my
mce
so
at
the
end
of
the
year

announced
on
the
radio
that
i
had
passed

was
the
happiest
personwhen
i
hadn
'
t
learnt
my
lesson
and
i
asked
the
teacher
to
give
me
a
three
and
he
agreed
but
even
he
felt
quite
awkward
nb
in
bulgarian
schools
a
three
is
the
second
worst
mark
hearing
about
a
friend
back
home
that
had
to
have
his
stomach
pumped
because
he
had
overdosed
on
pillswas
confronted
with
a
person

negative
thoughts
of
other
people
because
of
their
social
status
,
beliefs
,
color
and
outlook
on
life
(
perspective
)
when
i
was
curious
about
it
and
went
to
a
spiritism
session
with
a
friend
i
had
already
been
there
other
times
(
many
times
when
i
was
younger
)
but
that
day
,
even
if
i
don
'
t
believe
in
spiritism
i
was
terribly
afraid
that
something
would
happen
to
me

i
chatted
up
with
a
girl
who
i

she
however

with

felt
responsible
for
her
sorrowwhen
i
had
to
talk
with
an
important
person
about
a
job
when
i
was
travelling
to
school
by

i
went
past
a
place
where
a
sewer
had
been
repaired
there
was
a
bad
strong
smell
which
suffocated
me
and
i
wanted
to
leave
the
place
immediatelywhen
i
nearly
caused
a
traffic
accident
with
my
car
when
my
room
mate
was
making
noise
deliberately
,
by
playing
a
flute
early
in
the
morning
while
i
was
trying
to
studyhaving
finally
to
admit
i
was
wrong
,
after
having
denied
it
for
a
long
time
i
was
annoyed
this
particular
day
as
it
seemad
that
the
odds
were
not
in
my
favour
my
grandfather
added
fuel
to
the
fire
,
when
i
had
an
important
appointment

i
unleashed
my
anger
on
himi
worked
for
seven
months
in
a
factory
,
and
made
friends
with
a
fellow
worker
later
,
i
visited
my
former
fellow
workers
and
was
told
that
,
while
in
the
army
,
my
friend
had
shot
himself
when
my
father
suffered
with
dizziness
he
had
to
be
hospitalized
,
because
the
physician
didn
'
t
know
what
was
wrong
because
his
stools
were
black
,
i
thought
it
could
be
canceri
joked
with
an
unfamiliar
friend
in
an
obstinate
tone
i
was
afraid
of
his
misunderstanding
me
and
being
hurt
and
angry
at
me
i
felt
sorry
over
my
conduct
and
thought
that
i
had
to
find
an
opportunity
to
apologize
i
was
walking
home
with
a
friend
at
night
along
a
quiet
street
something
started
rustling
in
the
bush

got
burnt
because
of
my
negligence
to

the
child
away

found
a
cockroach
crushed
between
two
folders
in
my
bedroom
,
i
called
my

climbed
up

tree
to
pick
apples

angle
of
the
ladder

was
on

not
enable

implied

i
couldn

t
look
into

s
eyes
,
after
not
attending
his
lectures
i
was
disgusted
at
the
university
wanting
some
of
us
to
travel
from
our
homes
to
the
lectures
here
every
day
the
way
the
whole
thing
was
handled
disgusted
mei
did
badly
in
one
of
the
vital
exams
,
despite
getting
proper
guidance
from
my
parents

felt
guilty
of
improper
use
of
the
chances
provided
to
me
when
i
got
a
wedding
ring
of
diamond
from
the
boy
i
lovedafter
blowing
up
and
saying
all
the
wrong

realized
what
i
had
done
and
hurt
that
person
and
myself
a
few
years
back
i
had
proposed
love
to
a
girl
who
later
turned
out
to
be
related
to
me
though
we
were
in
love
with
each
other
,
we
both
felt
ashamed
and
withdrew
from
each
otheri
said
something
which
was
against
my
conscience
i
went
out
with
my
sister
,
her
boyfriend
and
his
friend
i
did
not
like
this
young
man
but
suddenly
he
overcame
me
and
kissed
me
he
was
very
strong
so
that
i
could
not
defend
myselfi
felt
something
close
to
that
when
i
saw
that
there
was
a
man
on
the
terrace
of
the
flat

sweatheart

got
problemsafter
having
considered

for
hours
i
was
able
to
overcome
my
scruples
and
to
call
a
friend
with
whom
i
had
fallen
in
love
i
realized
that
my
decision
was
right
and
was
very
glad
my
girlfriend
mentioned
a
certain
girl
'
s
name
who
was
my

towards

to
do
a
lot
of
efforts
to
make
something

with
my
help

would
have
finished
much
sooner
,
but
i
wasn

t
in
the
mood
to
help
himwhen
i
succeded
in
establishing
a
contact
with
a
girl
(
who

)
when
i
went
up
the
stairs
in
a
high
,
dark
house
full
of
shadows
,
passed
a
door
and
had
the
feeling
that
someone
or
something
was
behind
me
,
although
i
knew
i
was
alonewhen
i
was
finally
qualified
for
my
profession
when
i
finished
my
c
s
project
i
was
overjoyed
i
felt
relieved
because
it
was
due
the
next
day
and
i
was
tired
of
looking
at
itmy
brother
came
to
see
me
and
found
me
with
a
boy
friend
when
my
boyfriend
greeted
him
,

did
not
answer
and
instead

shouting
at
me

in
the
family
when

finished
a
relation
after

years
,
leading

close
friends
and
colleagues
talk
about
me
and
my
work
and
say
that
i
am
the
brightest
student
of

an
easy
one
and
went
wellwhen
i
had
sufficient
amount
of

a
good

clearly
showed
that
they
thought
i
was
naive
,
dull
and
unable
to
take
care
for
myself
,
while
i
expostulated
that
i
could
manage

were
informed
by
our
secretary
where
the
test
took
place
we
went
over
there
and
thought
there
was
a
course
so
we
went
back
again
i
felt
ashamed
that
the
secretary
again
should
see
mei
felt
much
anger
when
my
fahter
interferred
in
my
relations
with
another
person
whom
i
liked
very
much
,
ending
something
that
i
adored
when
the
brother
in
law
of
a
girlfriend
of
mine
found
us
in
a
bedroom
with
clothes
and
panties
spread
all
over
the
placecan
not
remember
when
i
was
complimented
and
called
delightfulwhen
my
grandfather
died
,
with
whom
i
had
a
very
close
relationship
i
was
sad
at
the
expulsion
of
some
of
my
comrades
during
the
unza
demonstrationsmy
friend
and
i
worked
for
the
community
centre
by
holding
a
booth
one
day
my
friend
went
off
to
another
booth
to
play
this
meant
that
i
was
very
busy
and
could
not
maintain
order
his
behaviour
disgusted
me
prolonged
niggling
of
friend
on
a
single
theme
which
i
considered
of
no
consequencewhen
i
got
a
low
grade
in
an
administration
course
i
couldn
'
t
sleep
,
and
began
to
remind
of
my
childhood
we
are
many
sisters
and
at
that
time
we
were
spanked
a
lot
and
i
don
'
t
know
why
i
started
to
remind
of
the
spanks
they
and
i
had
had
,
their
shouts
when
this
happenedon
my
birthday
i
got
a
present
that
i
had
desired
for
a
long
time
when
my
dog
was
stolennever
felt
the
emotion
i
was
angry
at
the
cafeteria
when
the
cook
scolded
and
said
many
bad
things
about
me
without
reason
he
thought
i
was
among
the
girls
who
did
him
wrongfinding
out
that
the
university
will
give
first
priority
to
qualified
practioners
and
clinical
years
to
go
to
your
english
lectures
i
needed
a
recommendation
for
something
i
decided
that
the
best
person
to
get
one
from
was
a
professor
who
i
had
never
talked
to
before
i
felt
a
lot
of
fear
going
up
after
class
to
ask
him
to
recommend
me
considering
he
had
never
heard
my
name
before
but
i
didmy
best
friend
had
a
relatively
severe
illness
i
was
sad
because
she
was
suffering
i
felt
very
sad
when
i
left
home
because
i
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
i
do
not
regret
it
,
but
i
missed
my
little
sister
very
much
(
and
she
missed
me
)
these
feelings
wear
off
over
timea
few
weeks
back
i
had
a
very
important
seminar
and
i
had
circulated
my
papers
to
all
the
panel
members
a
day
before
the
seminar
i
realized
that
i
had
inadvertantly
burdened
certain
derivations
and
i
had
failed
to
correct
it
i
feared
that
this
would
reflect
very
badly
on
my
performance
fortunately
none
of
the
panel
members
detected
it
and
i
felt
relieved
not
having
owned
up
to
the
responsibility
an
incident
where
family
car
received
minor
damagea
relative
not
acting
on
her
promise
i
had
got
a
bad
cold
my
father
said
i
must
be
crazy
to
go
by
motorbike
at
those
temperatures
when
i
answered
him
that
i
did
not
care
about
a
cold
,
he
said
that
if
i
did
not
care
for
anything
i
could
leave
him
(
it
was
for
the
second
time
he
said
something
like
that
)when
a
thief
entered
the
house
in
which
i
was
sleeping
as
i
usually
do
not
start
learning
until
a
short
time
before
an
examination
,
,
i
once
made
up
my
mind
to
try
to
work
for
a
longer
time
but
once
again
i
did
not
do
it
and
got
a
bad
markwhen
i
got
first
division
in
the
exams
before
leaving
school
somebody
wanted
to
beat
my
brother
at
a
wedding
ceremony
and
i
was
trying
to
protect
my
brother
but
the
other
man
was
calling
names
to
both
of
ussouth

well
in

my
mother
did
not
come
home
till
late
at
night
(
ages
ago
)
anyway
if
i
don
'
t
know
where
my
parents
are
and
when
they
'
ll
be
back
i
start
thinking
that
perhaps
they
have
had
an
accident
and
are
perhaps
deadwhen
a
friend
,
who
has
been
with
me
at
school
,
failed
to
make
it
to
unza
when
i
got
engaged
to
a
boy
of
my
choicewhen
my
sister
after
a
history
of
one
abortion
and
one
stillbirth
gave
birth
to
a
perfectly
healty
boy
i
work
at
a
day
care
centre
,
and
one
day
when
the
children
were
outdoors
a
four
year
old
boy
disappeared
from
the
yard
i
was
not
looking
after
them
then
,
but
as
the
manager
it
was
me
who
was
responsiblemy
brother
told
me
that
a
person
(
whom
i
know
)
had
insulted
him
i
am
very
fond
of
my
brother
,
and
as
he
himself
can
not
get
angry
or
hurt
,
my
protectiveness
was
aroused
and
i
got
angry
when
i
was
face
to
face
with
my
deceived
friend
after
sleeping
with
his
wifewhen
my
father
'
s
home
was
to
be
broken
into
by
thieves
who
had
guns
i
was
having
an
argument
with
my
brother
on
his
behavior
,
then
we
started
fighting
and
i
got
annoyed
at
him
because
he
started
teasing
methe
behaviour
of
people
spitting
everywhere
a
truth
expressed
unthinkingly
at
a
coffee
party
i
realized
later
that
i
had
been
inconsiderate
,
at
a
wrong
moment
and
the
wrong
placei
came
home
one
day
and
discovered
that
my
sister
had
borrowed
my
car
and
had
gotten
into
an
accident
with
it
my
entire
front
bumper
was
destroyed
after
a
pleasant
evening
with
friends
in
my
flat
,
one
of
them
did
not
want
to
leave
,
because
he
wanted
to
sleep
with
me
he
said
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
me
,
that
he
felt
alone
and
so
onwhen
i
pass
an
exam
now
that
the
49ers
are
winners
,
the
fans
are
coming
out
of
the
woodwork
and
jumping
on
the
bandwagon
and
that
disgusts
meon
one
occasion
whilst
engaging
in
horseplay
with
my
girlfriend
,
i
caused
her
to
be
physically
harmed
one
day
my
colleague
misbehaved
with
me
i
felt
disgusted
and
thought
to
myself
that
he
could
only
do
this
because
i
was
a
womanpromising
to
do
a
task
for
a
friend
and
just
forgetting
about
it
i
was
scared
when
i
realized
that
i
might
miss
the
train
which
i
was
supposed
to
take
i
was
1500
kilometres
away
from
home
and
when
i
heard
the
depart
whistle
i
was
still
150
feet
away
from
the
train
i
finally
made
iti
read
a
book
about
torture
the
book
described
exactly
how
the
torturing
was
done
some
boys
boasting
about
their
ability
to
tell
dirty
jokesonce
in
my
work
it
happened
a
fight
between
the
person
in
charge
and
me
i
got
so
angry
and
spoke
out
everything
i
felt
at
the
moment
i
have
experienced
disgust
with
some
people
usually
double
dealersfirst
time
in

alone
in
europe
and
having
to
catch
a

bus
on
my
way

a
man
sitting
opposite
me
kept
looking
at
me
continously
i
did
not
know
what
was
wrong
when
i
reached
the
centre
i
started
strolling
around
as
i
still
had
a
little
time
suddenly
a
man
came
and
whispered
you
have
forgotten
to
zip
up
your
trousers
i
was
at
a
loss
to
say
anything
and
i
felt
very
embarrassed
when
i
thought
of
the

incident
i
felt
even
more
ashamed

the
same
instant
the
pastry
felt
on
the
floor
i
spied
on
my
fianct
and
was
terribly
jealous
later
i
saw
that
there
was
no
reason
for
thatwhen
i
passed
the
university
entrance
exam
when
i
told
my
uncle
a
false
story
that
people
had
stolen
the

from
my
room
and
i
demanded
money
from
him
when
he
found
out
the
truth

was
in
troublewhen

did
not
send
me

his
tongue
was
swollen
and
he
told
his
mother
about
it
the
mother
reported
it
to
the
headmaster
who
threatened
to
expel
us
when
i
did
not
get
admission
in

sc
after
my
b
sc
,

really
bad
when

started
my
journey
to
bombay
,
after
having
accepted
my
uncle
'
s
offer
to
come
to
bombay
,
i
was
afraid
,
wondering
if
i
would
succeed
or
notwhen
i
felt
alone
and
without
love

person
misinterpreted
what
i
had
told
her
i

told
her
that

that
he
was
drunk
until
we
were
in
the
car
he
was
madly
racing
several
times
we
were
in
dangerous
situations
and
i
told
him
to
be
cautious

but
he
did
not
care

was
appreciated
by
others

especially
my
family

my
friendsbefore

had
to

in
brisbane
(
the
big
smoke
)
leaving
home
,
my
family
,
and
moving
to
such
a
big
place
was
quite
intimidating
at
first
,
and
i
was
anxious
about
it
when
i
took
a
car
which
was
not
mine
,
and
suddenly
it
stopped
workingwhen
somebody
suddenly
said
something
(
about
me
)
at
a
wrong
moment
and
i
didn
'
t
agree
(
at
that
exact
moment
i
was
needing
an
extremely
positive
word
)

to

for
a
long
time
the
last
time
i
went
to
her
city
,
just
to
see
her
,
i
was
disappointed
to
see
how
great
the
distance
between
us
wasdeath
of
general
ye
jianying
a
time
when
i
was
very
afraid
of
something
was
when
i
broke
my
father
'
s
antique
lampthe
day
i
was
told
that
i
had
passed
my
malawi
school
leaving
exams
and
i
was
selected
to
go
to
college
when
i
was
young
i
had
gone
to
an
old
lift
and
played
with
the
antique
lift
the
guy
discovered
me
and
warned
me
,
i
was
very
frightenedi
have
once
been
very
sad
and
lonely
this
was
when
i
was
trying
to
organize
a
play
as
a
student
(
15
years
)
instead
of
materializing
,
it
fizzled
out
the
worst
thing
was
that
the
play
fell
apart
completely
and
i
found
myself
weeping
uncontrollably
now
when
i
think
of
it
,
i
laugh
it
off
but
at
that
time
it
was
intense
i
had
a
feeling
of
shame
when
i
found
myself
unable
to
answer
some
questions
from
my
tutor
simply
because
of
a
lack
of
preparationwhen
working
in
a
chemical
laundry
,
i
saw
rats
and
maggots
in
the
washing
one
of
my
pupils
escaped
from
school
to
the
streeti
caught
a
huge
eel
on
a
fishing
line
which
i
had
pulled
into
the
boat
i
cut
the
line
and
threw
the
whole
lot
back
into
the
water
later
that
day
and
about
ten
miles
away
i
went
swimming
and
someone
made
the
comment
wondering
how
far
eels
could
swim
,
i
abruptly
ended
swimming
for
fear
at
an
unseen
eel
for
a
few
days
until
we
had
left
the
district
i
felt
fear
when
my
mother
was
heavily
illonce
a
friend
had
pushed
me
and
i
had
fallen
on
to
a
window
which
then
broke
i
was
taken
to
tthe
principal
'
s
office
and
he
accused
me
of
having
broken
the
window
when
i
told
off
a
computer
teacher
who
did
not
want
to
teach
me
beacause
of
prejudicei
had
not
written
to
,
or
called
my
grandmother
,
who
was
lonely
,
for
a
long
time
my
mother
asked
me
to
call
her
on
her
behalf
and
when
i
did
so
,
my
grandmother
was
delighted
and
she
told
me
that
she
had
been
waiting
for
some
news
from
us
almost
crashing
my
car
,
something
which
could
have
led
to
great
problemsi
dreamed
that
this
girl
and
i
were
cuddling
in
bed
when
my
girlfriend
walked
in
i
really
love
my
girlfriend
so
i
felt
guilty
and
sad
i
know
that
this
is
a
wierd
example
but
the
dream
and
the
feeling
was
clear
to
me
as
if
it
had
really
happened
when
in
my
childhood
we
were
forced
to
take
cod
liver
oilcelebrations
on
the
graduation
day
with
the
orchestra
playing
in
the
garden
(
i
am
a
part
of
this
orchestra
)
a
certain
girl
asked
me
what
my
major
was
and
when
i
told
her
that
it
was
p
a
she
started
criticizing
it
saying
,
i
hate
that
course
she
just
shows
off
in
front
of
other
peoplein
the
student
'
s
union
there
was
someone
who
took
the
photocopies
of
two
large
volumes
i
asked
him
to
let
me
take
a
few
,
he
refused
it
for
an
acceptable
reason
a
very
close
friend
left
meafter
making
an
effort
to
enter
at
university
i
found
a
course
and
a
school
of
higher
education
which
were
compatible
with
my
experience
and
potentiality
maltreatment
of
childrenmy
grandmother
was
about
to
die
,
and
it
had
the
effect
that
at
night
,
after
having
read
a
book
,
and
once
in
bed
,
in
perfect
darkness
,
the
fear
arose
that
i
too
may
suddenly
die
i
feel
ashamed
every
time
that
someone
makes
me
a
positive
or
negative
criticsome
of
my
friends
had
an
argument
i
had
earlier
phoned
one
of
them
and
that
may
have
influenced
him
to
argue
when
i
was
a
child
,
i
had
a
medical
check
up
i
had
to
undress
myself
and
was
examined
by
several
doctorsi
was
afraid
of
a
certain
examination
although
i
was
relatively
well
prepared
i
had
too
much
homework
and
examinations
and
i
did
not
know
how
to
organize
my
worki

shame
when
i
do
not
arrive
on
time
and
others
have
to
wait
for
me
for
a
long
time
i
went
to
a
party
and
there
were
some
cakes
which
weren
'
t
good
and
had
a
bad
smellsincerely
i
'
m
a
very
timid
guy
and
so
even
in
very
simple
situations
sometimes
i
am
ashamed
once
when
i
crossed
the
street
,
and
was
nearly
trampled
by
a
carwhen
i
took
away
my
best
friend

host
for
a
friend
from
a
far
away
place

had
been
rude

at
a
time
when
she
needed
comforting
,
not
anger
(
death
of
my
sister
)i
haven
'
t
often
felt
this
feeling
once
someone
stole
my
garment
when
i
stole
a
packet
of
cigarettes
from
a
neighbour
and
the
next
day
i
owned

i
exceeded
the
time

had
been
satisfied
withthis
happened
when
i
went
to
check
my
first
year
results

had
thought
that
i
would
fail
and
i
found
that
i
had
a
clear
pass
in
all
my
courses
when
i
left
a
man
in
whom
i
really
believedonce
when
i
was
in
the
cell
group
(
religious
activity
)
i
found
that
almost
everyone
in
the
group
read
the
bible
daily
and
i
felt
guilty
in
my
heart
when
my
daughter
began
staying
away
from
classes
at
the
age
of
nine
onlywhen
i
as
a
pakeha
(
white
)
new
zealander
,
was
just
as
racially
prejudiced
as
other
people
whom
i
had
condemned
i
and
my
cousin
went
to
a
filmshow
at
night
we
went
without
making
it
known
to
my
mother
while
we
were
there
at
interval
,
i
came
across
my
mother
just
close
to
where
we
sati
saw
a
film
where
snakes
were
crawling
everywhere
i
felt
them
crawling
over
all
my
body
with
that
skins
the
noise
that
they
did
disturbed
me
very
much
when
i
shouted
and
quarrelled
and
for
no
reason
i
had
been
rude
to
my
mother
and
when
my
behaviour
had
been
influenced
by
other
outward
factorswhen
i
used
an
adjective
for
a
person
without
knowing
what
it
meant
when
i
got
to
know
the
meaning
,
i
felt
guilty
as
it
was
a
clear
and
unfair
insult
saw
a
blue
film
in
a
cinemai
passed
successfully
the
preliminary
exam
for
a
participation
in
the
children
assembly
i
wore
a
dirty
dress
a
certain
day
i
was
going
to
town
i
met
an
old
friend
who
made
a
comment
about
my
dress
so
i
felt
ashameda
person
with
whom
i
had
been
on
bad
terms
,
gave
me
a
present
we
became
reconciled
my
roommate
messing
up
our
roomone
day
when
i
was
working
,
i
went
out
for
dinner
with
friends
without
my
parents
knowledge
and
i
only
came
home
at
2300
hours
when
i
was
young
i
felt
ashamed
when
our
relatives
visited
us
and
i
hid
myselfwhen
i
heard
that
there
had
been
some
women
raped
at
uni
,
just
near
where
i
usually
park
my
car
and
walk
by
myself
at
night
although
i
wasn
'
t
in
danger
it
unnerved
me
for
days
and
i
was
fearful
whenever
walking
through
the
area
when
i
failed
the
grade
seven
examswhen
i
found
out
that
the
guy
i
was
dating
at
a
particular
time
had
a
steady
relationship
going
on
with
someone
else
for
a
long
time
i
felt
disgust
with
the
alcohol
,
after
i
happened
to
see
a
young
man
,
who
was
dead
to
the
world
and
who
wallowed
on
the
pavement
this
sight
i
watched
from
the
busknowing
that
i
had
to
do
the
survey
with
him
i
felt
very
reluctant
although
i
do
not
know
him
i
feel
disgusted
by
just
looking
at
him
thinking
that
the
project
lasted
several
days
i
regreted
having
joined
that
project
one
of
my
flatmates
and
i
came
back
to
the
flat
monday
morning
,
to
find
a
real
mess
,
left
by
the
guy
we
share
withmade
a
wonderful
driend
who
understands
me
this
happened
when
i
could
not
get
into
the
school
i
had
initially
wanted
,
and
ended
up
doing
something
i
had
never
thought
i
would
dothere
is
a
boy
who
i
love
very
much
i
asked
him
to
have
dinner
with
me
,
but
he
refused
i
don
'
t
know
why
he
didn
'
t
go
with
me
,
but
i
felt
very
lonely
the
fact
that
i
was
pregnant
i
was
always
considered
level
headed
and
did
not
have
sex
until
18
and
out
of
high
schoolonce
i
spoke
without
thinking
very
much
it
was
quite
a
nonsense
when
my
father
passed
away
in
1978
i
was
left
alone
with
my
mother
who
was
very
sick
so
i
had
to
go
and
live
with
my
aunt
,
who
is
very
short
tempered
,
till
my
mother
was
discharged
from
the
hospitalmy
brother
lost
his
temper
and
started
smashing
things
in
the
house
i
was
quite
scared
,
that
something
terrible
might
happen
,
till
the
situation
was
brought
under
control
hearing
of
a
filthy
situation
over
the
phonewhen
i
fell
crazily
in
love
with
a
beautiful
girl
and
she
returned
my
love
when
first
came
to
cal
i
went
to
a
rally
on
sproul
and
i
later
learned
that
the
rally
was
conducted
by
the
moonie
cult
they
were
taking
pictures
at
the
rally
,
so
i
was
afraid
that
they
would
circulate
the
pictures
and
then
kidnap
people
i
did
not
know
how
the
cult
worked
i
was
scaredmy
parents
came
to
visit
me
when
my
last
year
'
s
second
semester
results
came
through
i
was
ecstaticmy
companion
admired
me
when
i
did
some
work
voluntarily
walking
alone
in
the
dark
in
a
strange
streetunexpectedly
i
met
some
persons
who
i
like
very
much
spontaneously
they
invited
me
and
integrated
me
within
their
group
,
although
it
was
late
in
the
evening
i
was
very
scared
when
i
went
to
the
examination
hall
for
my
m
sc
examination
as
i
had
studied
a
limited
partion
of
the
course
thoroughly
and
i
was
in
great
doubt
whether
that
would
be
askedat
set
backs
at
one
time
while
at
primary
school
i
lost
a
pencil
case
of
a
friend
and
i
didn
'
t
mention
it
to
her
until
after
a
fortnightfeeling
unable
to
preserve
one
'
s
ideas
and
ambitions
as
innocent
as
they
are
when
you
are
young
when
i
woke
up
after
a
night
of
drinking
i
couldn
'
t
remember
and
discovered
several
untoward
things
had
occurreddiscussing
with
a
certain
person
about
a
job
i
was
getting
and
that
perosn
was
negative
and
pessimistic
finding
out
about
chinese
money
cannot
buy
foreign
journalsat
an
unjust
insult
or
injure
when
i
heard
that
i
had
passed
my
end
of
first
year
exams
and
i
was
ready
to
enter
2nd
year
because
i
felt
i
had
failed
as
they
were
very
hardi
was
not
sure
whether
i
should
help
an
old
woman
going
down
a
flight
of
stairs
i
just
watched
her
and
saw
how
difficult
it
was
for
her
to
do
it
i
had
,
by
being
silent
,
disapproved
my
love
and
made
him
unhappy
he
had
not
been
able
to
keep
his
promise
i
thus
was
thinking
about
my
own
conduct
towards
another
personno
response
i
broke
a
cup
and
put
it
back
without
telling
anyone
about
it
and
someone
almost
got
blamed
for
it
,
then
it
was
discovered
that
it
was
me
who
had
broken
itgoing
to
a
disco
by
myself
to
wait
for
some
friends
we
had
separated
and
hadn
'
t
planned
where
to
meet
i
wasn
'
t
sure
if
they
were
even
going
to
this
place
so
i
felt
very
conscious
of
being
alone
when
i
went
to
town
in
a
double
dekker
bus
the
bus
was
about
to
fall
on
the
way
when
the
driver
controlled

almost
fallenlast

did
well
on
some

i
seemed
to
finally
adjust
to
college
,
it
was
hot
and
sunny
i
was
walking
in
front
of
a
frat
when
i
heard
beach
boys
surfin
'
usa
i
had
this
overwhelming
feeling
that
to
be
at
cal
was
good
i
still
have
it
somewhat
when
i
gave
birth
to
my
son
and
saw
that
he
was
alive
and
that
i
had
managed
it
well
he
was
born
a
month
too
early
with
a
malfunctioning
lung
this
happened
a
year
agowhen
i
found
out
that
my
girlfriend
would
not
be
coming
back
to
ucb
for
one
semester
,
but
would
be
living
in
san
jose
a
shop
in
downtown
wouldn
'
t
accept
my
visa
card
before
december
last
yearwhen
i
noticed
that
my
little
sister
was
sulking
,
because
i
could
not
meet
her
because
of
a
misunderstanding
when
a
relative
,
who
had
come
to
our
place
,
created
untidyness
and
dirtynessat
a
party
in
which
i
met
an
interesting
female
we
enjoyed
eachothers
company
,
while
slow
dacing
when
i
got
into
a
bus
i
found
that
my
wallet
had
been
stolen
it
was
not
a
great
loss
from
the
monetary
point
of
view
but
i
lost
some
documents
identity
papers
as
a
result
i
had
to
spend
several
days
in
order
to
get
a
new
one
i
will
always
remember
all
the
work
i
had
to
do
and
the
bad
treatment
i
suffered
because
of
the
bureaucratic
behaviour
of
the
civil
servant
i
had
already
had
bad
luck
and
they
treated
me
like
a
criminal
at
one
point
of
time
i
really
wanted
to
quarrel
with
themi
called
off
a
relationship
with
one
girl
so
i
could
see
another
once
,
late
at
night
,
i
was
biking
home
and
overtook
a
man
he
said
to
me
hello
darling
i
was
terrified
and
imagined
the
wildest
scenesi
have
a
fobic
anxiety
for
elevators
this
anxiety
is
worst
at
the
moment
when
the
doors
have
to
open
i
have
it
often
in
the
elevator
at
our
university
my
brother
in
law
was
dying
of
cancer
to
see
him
wasting
away

very
sadi

guilty
when
i
was
robbed
of
a
friend

s
radio
at
lilongwe
bus
depot
after
promising
that
i
would
keep
it
safe
not
being
able
to
convince
my
class
leader
that
my
friend
is
better
than
me
to
go
to
the
english
lecturesmy
boyfriend
and
i
were
getting
dressed
up
and
putting
make
up
on
to
go
to
a
halloween
party
we
were
dressing
up
to
be
two
mimes
it
was
very
enjoyable
and
i
thought
we
looked
really
good
,
it
was
an
accomplishment
we
were
alone
in
his
house
when
my
mother
treats
me
as
a
10
year
old
boygood
news
about
a
sick
relative
i
am
ashamed
of
the
way
my
father
behaves
with
my
mother
and
sister
,
and
with
me
tooi
felt
very
happy
when
i
heard
i
had
passed
the
examination
to
move
up
to
the
second
year
course
when
i
found
my
baby
whipped
by
my
auntie
i
was
really
sad
and
up
to
this
moment
my
sadness
is
still
ona
young
man
was
insulting
and
humiliating
a
drunken
man
last
year
i
was
asked
to
look
after
my
niece
while
her
mother
was
cooking
unfortunately
the
kid
fell
off
the
bed
,
i
was
confident
that
she
would
not
fall
and
had
not
been
paying
much
attentionin
the
underground
'
s
escalator
,
a
youngish
bum
asked
me
for
money
although
i
did
not
give
him
anything
,
the
fellow
told
me
that
i
was
really
good
looking
a
man
who
was
in
front
of
me
also
turned
to
look
at
me
i
was
accepted
by
the
chinese
universitymotorcyclistic
accident
where
for
some
minutes
i
didn
'
t
know
if
i
was
alive
or
dead
,
i
remained
cold
levered
during
the
situation
but
felt
great
fear
i
was
told
quite
unexpectedly
that
one
wanted
me
to
become
the
vice
chairman
of
our
student
organisation
i
was
really
surprised
and
joy
was
the
first
emotion
i
felt
,
though
behind
it
there
was
worry
how
shall
i
succeed
?i
thought
that
i
could
have
avoided
the
above
situation
(
the
one
in
fear
)
if
i
had
concentrated
more
on
my
work
,
which
i
hate
on
the
cliff
by
the
sea
,
the
silence
and
the
sudden
voice
of
a
bird
(
swans
of
the
bay
)i
was
not
,
i
am
not
,
i
will
never
ever
feel
ashamed
of
myself
for
something
i
have
done
i
felt
disgust
with
a
person
whose
behaviour
was
out
of
the
elementary
human
normswhen
as
a
child
i
stole
,
from
a
friend
of
mine
,
the
ring
she
had
got
in
an
easter
egg
1976
,
soweto
uprising
in
south
africa
and
the
racist
gout
'
s
reaction
to
the
students
demands
concerning
the
educational
systemwhen
we
received
our
academic
result
i
learnt
that
my
results
were
bad
as
i
had
not
done
my
best
the
results
of
my
accquaintances
were
good
and
when
they
asked
me
about
my
results
i
really
did
not
want
to
answer
the
emotion
came
to
me
when
a
certain
girl
who
was
not
polite
to
her
mother
hit
her
sister
severelymy
patient
died
of
anaemia
while
i
was
organising
blood
transfusion
for
him
,
so
i
felt
guilty
,
because
i
thought
that
may
be
i
was
slow
when
my
father
asked
me
if
i
was
a
communist
,
at
the
same
time
he
made
it
clear
that
i
should
no
longer
see
myself
as
his
daughterwhen
i
was
walking
along
a
road
alone
on
my
way
to
go
shopping
this
monday
i
took
a
math
1bs
test
and
flunked
for
the
second
timewhen
somebody
i
knew
greeted
me
and
started
to
talk
with
me
and
i
didn
'
t
know
,
i
couldn
'
t
remember
who
he
was
i
cannot
remember
a
situation
in
which
i
felt
ashamed
i
was
eating
with
some
people
and
a
little
boy
i
took
care
of
i
warned
him
often
not
to
knock
down
his
glass
of
mild
when
i
took
out
his
chair
i
knocked
down
my
own
glassi
gave
some
personal
information
to
a
friend
of
mine
,
and
he
told
it
to
some
others
who
were
implicated
in
the
affair
when
i
passed
my
b
a
examsi
didn
'
t
do
an
important
job
and
it
had
an
adverse
effect
on
other
people
when
my
cousin
passed
away
unexpectedly
and
tragically
(
a
murder
)i
met
my
present
boyfriend
on
a
boat
trip
to
england
we
had
said
that
we
would
call
each
other
when
we
got
back
to
sweden
(
we
were
not
going
to
the
same
town
in
england
)
as
soon
as
i
walked
in
he
called
from
england
as
he
could
not
wait
till
he
came
home
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
a
bad
habit
and
it
seemed
that
i
had
succeeded
however
a
year
later
i
got
the
bad
habit
again
i
felt
useless
as
i
always
found
excuses
to
explain
my
behaviour
as
a
result
i
felt
guiltyi
wrote
a
letter
to
my
father
to
ventilate
my
bottled
up
feelings
afterwards
i
thought
it
was
too
negative
finding
out
that
china
is
still
backward
in
sciencei
insulted
two
of
my
friends
because
i
thought
that
had
been
gossiping
about
me
right
under
my
nose
,
however
i
later
found
out
that
they
were
not
doing
so

to
keep
an
appointmenti

the

should
not
have
said
in

t
felt
shame
for
agesi
did
not
go
to
help
a
friend
of
mine
,
though
she
probably
needed
me
when
a
professor
of
this
faculty

at

and
was
suspicious
of
a
composition
written
by
a
class
mate

had
been
together
with
my

another

and
not
even
tried
to
conceal
that
from
me
i
drew
my
conclusions
and
left
him

a
bit
guilty
for
what

happenedi

my
head
into
the
pullover
of
a
girl
to
see
her
breasts
the

at

at
a
time
when
i
was
completely
broken
we
got
into
a
fight
with
some
chaps
in
front
of
our
family
house
the
value
of
the
property
destroyed
was
approximately
15
000
fim
i
felt
ashamed
when
my
parents
came
to
know
about
thiswhen
i
heard
the
examination
results
and
when
i
recovered
after
having
been
sick
for
a
week
when
i
left
a
carnaval
ball
at
4
o
'
clock
a
m
i
was
alone
in
a
foreign
city
and
i
had
to
go
back
home
,
when
a
guy
appeared
and
tried
to
catch
mea
kitten
had
wandered
into
our
office
,
and
i
was
told
to
take
it
back
across
the
street
when
i
crossed
back
,
the
kitten
followed
me
and
was
run
over
and
killed
by
a
car
when
my
brother
was
born
,
everything
went
all
right
it
had
been
very
likely
that
he
would
have
a
deficiency
(
my
sister
suffers
from
down
'
s
syndrome
)
and
that
my
mother
would
be
in
dangeri
had
taken
the
responsibility
to
do
something
and
i
had
prepared
for
it
however
i
failed
because
of
my
timidity
after
three
attempts
i
still
could
not
adapt
to
the
atmosphere
and
failed
as
before
i
felt
imcompetent
and
felt
that
the
others
would
think
that
i
had
not
prepared
for
it
i
was
afraid
when
my
dog
ran
out
through
a
crack
in
the
fence
when
a
train
was
comingspontaneous
picnic

sister
and
friend

too
eager
approach
by
a
dirty
drunken
person
in
a
bus
when
i
first
suffered
from
syphilisit
was
saturday
,
my
duties
were
over
for
a
few
hours
and
i
could
at
last
be
with
the
people
i
wanted
to
see
the
negative
feelings
towards
me
displayed
by
my
parents
in
lawwhen
i
had
to
finish
those
big
amounts
of
homework
in
time
a
very
,
very
close
friend
of
mine
used
to
come
to
my
room
to
see
me
and
i
naver
bothered
to
pay
him
a
visit
one
day
he
asked
me
the
reason
behind
this
and
i
gave
him
a
shirtdisgust
with
drunk
people
relating
to
my
closest
familyin
a
conversation
my
boyfriend
expressed
definite
and
quite
pretentious
opinions
and
he
took
up
an
attitude
towards
a
theory
which
he
himself
had
never
known
his
information
was
from
fortuitous
sources
passing
an
examination
,
although
i
felt
sure
i
had
failedwhile
shopping
,
a
person
close
to
us
created
an
uncomfortable
situation
for
those
who
were
with
her
as
i
was
not
paying
attention
,
my
little
brother
fell
off
the
tablewhen
my
mother
caught
me
masturbating
when
i
was
about
six
years
old
,
i
mistook
a
cat
for
a
leopard
when
it
entered
my
room
at
nightat
school
,
when
the
only
thing
people
my
age
could
think
of
was
getting
rolling
drunk
they
couldn
'
t
have
a
good
time
without
firstly
getting
drunk
it
made
me
very
sad
to
hear
that
some
construction
company
was
going
to
build
houses
on
the
beautiful
hills
by
my
housei
misunderstood
a
girl
and
thought
that
she
loved
me
one
day
when
i
was
talking
to
her
,
her
boyfriend
appeared
and
i
felt
ashamed
my
girlfriend
let
me
down
badly
3
times
in
one
week
these
instances
summed
up
all
the
negative
aspects
of
our
relationship
which
at
the
time
seemed
doomed
to
failwhen
i
had
to
walk
home
in
the
dark
for
the
first
time
once
while
playing
tennis
with
my
classmate
i
lost
a
few
tennis
balls
i
found
one
near
the
tennis
court
and
took
it
to
be
mine
despite
thinking
that
it
might
belong
to
the
student
in
the
next
court
i
felt
guilty
later
someone
came
to
me
to
claim
the
ball
and
i
gave
it
back
to
himwhen
a
little
brother
of
mine
damaged
a
cassette
when
they
put
the
blame
on
me
when
i
scored
the
third
goal
at
the
matchas
for
disgust
as
a
child

going
to
school
i
usually
take
something
to
eat
right
at
school
and
this
time
i
took
father
'
s
money
without
him
knowing
it
i
felt
guilty
and
i
returned
the
money
when
i
slapped
a
nephew
who
did
something
that
i
considered
wrong
,
and
i
was
reprehended
for
thiswhen
i
am
made
to
do
things
in
which
i
see
no
sense
and
i
waste
my
time
some
time
ago
i
had
to
participate
in
a
sociological
investigation
and
then
i
got
really
angry
a
friend
came
to
visit
me
late
one
night
he
promised
to
stay
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
but
he
stayed
5
hours
!
!
he
didn
'
t
leave
and
i
was
very
angrybeing
told
that
i
have
not
got
a
personality
when
my
brother
came
back
home
after
staying
in
hospital
he
had
undergone
an
operation
which
had
been
a
matter
of
life
or
death
when
he
came
home
i
could
see
him
smile
for
the
first
time
after
may
weekswhen
i
fell
in
love
with
x
overnight
i
felt
confidence
,
self
esteem
,
responsible
and
worthwhile
when
it
was
discovered
that
i
had
done
the
assignment
at
my
work
place
,
this
caused
a
lot
of
embarrassment
for
mefailed
to
do
what
i
had
promised
insulted
by
the
class
leaderwhen
i
got
the
midterm
exam
results
,
the
results
were
below
average
and
were
near
the
lowest
i
was
scared
of
the
final
exam
a
friend
unjustly
put
the
blame
on
me
to
relieve
his
conscience
and
also
spread
lies
for
the
same
purposeduring
a
discussion
i
reacted
very
aggressively
and
so
i
made
it
impossible
to
continue
discussing
the
time
i
went
to
see
one
of
my
girlfriends
at
area
18
i
found
that
she
was
not
there
but
in
the
room
she
was
sleeping
,
in
the
same
room
there
were
some
women
visitors
with
children
so
the
room
was
smelling
very
badly
with
some
faeces
and
urine
in
it
so
i
didn
'
t
stay
any
longerdid
well
in
an
examn
just
before
my
father
'
s
birthday
the
best
present
i
can
give
to
my
father
my
brother
accused
me
undeservedly
before
my
parents
i
was
not
guilty
he
was
misled
by
his
wifeit
was
in
december
last
year
that
i
was
chosen
to
come
to
this
institution
to
study
as
a
medical
assistant
when
i
heard
on
the
radio
that
the
football
match
in
belgium
had
ended
in
a
catastrophe
,
and
several
people
had
died
i
could
not
understand
how
normal
people
could
behave
in
such
a
waywhen
going
out
in
the
weekend
i
have
to
bike
5
kilometers
through
lonely
and
dark
polders
,
then
i
always
have
terrifying
fantasies
could
not
buy
a
reference
book
because
i
got
up
too
late
to
cuegoing
to
take
my
driving
test
i
put
on
a
lot
of
weight
in
a
few
months
and
every
time
i
met
someone
i
knew
would
avoid
them
,
usually
by
hiding
because
my
self
image
was
low
and
i
was
ashamed
of
what
i
had
done
to
myselfi
was
supposed
to
do
something
and
didn
'
t
the
person
was
really
dependiong
on
me
i
had
to
leave
my
girlfriend
for
4
weeks
because
of
my
studies
this
happens
frequently
the
last
24
hours
before
my
departure
are
always
very
depressingwhen
the
dean
of
unza
asked
me
to
vacate
a
big
flat
i
was
occupying
and
take
up
a
smaller
one
as
i
was
becoming
a
full
time
student
at
unza
a
good
friend
,
the
wife
of
the
vicar
of
my
church
came
up
to
me
from
the
pews
(
i
am
in
the
choir
)
and
shook
my
hand
during
the
time
for
an
informal
greeting
in
the
church
service
she
said
a
few
wordswhen
i
failed
one
of
my
courses
at
school
the
university
of
zambia
when
i
arrived
home
late
at
night
i
know
that
my
mother
gets
worried
and
this
made
me
feel
angryi
was
disgusted
to
find
out
that
the
water
isn
'
t
filtered
or
purified
before
it
leaves
latimer
hall
from
the
drains
when
the
girl
i
loved
turned
me
downyears
ago
i
fell
in
love
for
the
first
time
as
natural
for
every
school
girl
i
was
day
dreaming
later
(
after
3
years
)
we
left
each
other
no
one
was
to
blame
but
i
felt
deep
sadness
even
now
i
remember
about
it
quite
often
at
a
party
i
saw
two
persons
having
a
fight
the
aggressions
and
the
hate
between
these
persons
produced
an
unpleasant
impression
on
menot
collecting
letters
for
my
friend
al
i
promised
just
before
i
started
my
study
i
had
to
move
,
i
was
very
afraid
to
be
left
alone
and
that
i
could
not
manage
itwhen
i
see
that
some
people
remain
cold
and
egoistic
with
regard
to
close
friends
,
even
in
situations
that
those
friends
need
them
at
what
i
was
capable
of
of
selfishly
using
others
for
sexual
encounters
,
while
i
held
a
vision
of
having
a
deepening
above
board
(
you
know
,
girl
next
door
)
devotion
to
a
girl
in
my
head
my
drives
and
actions
did
not
match
this
so
consequently
i
felt
disgusted
at
my
failurei
was
walking
one
day
and
i
met
a
man
who
wanted
to
ask
me
about
my
brother
but
i
didn
'
t
stop
to
hear
what
he
was
saying
i
was
ashamed
when
i
found
him
at
home
and
he
told
my
brother
what
had
happened
when
i
knew
that
my
niece
did
a
bad
schoolar
examination
because
i
couldn
'
t
explain
her
the
lessonmy
dog
died
of
a
cerebral
tumor
when
i
discovered
that
my
mother
had
been
involved
in
adulterymy
parents
appreciate
very
much
me
and
my
boyfriend
coming
and
have
dinner
with
them
at
christmas
however
we
decided
to
visit
his
parents
my
mother
was
rather
disappointed
being
insulted
in
publicwhen
i
was
on
holiday
someone
vomited
in
front
of
me
when
after
10
months
of
national
service
i
was
downgraded
and
did
not
have
to
do
the
remaining
5
monthsthe
day
that
there
was
a
black
out
in
the
city
,
and
i
was
in
an
exposition
,
i
felt
fear
that
something
more
serious
was
happening
,
like
a
revolution
for
example
when
i
made
love
with
a
girl
,
which
i
don
'
t
really
love
however
i
know
that
she
loves
mebeing

of

day
i
was
angry
with
my
friend
who
went
into
my
drawer
and
took
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
i
wanted
to
write
a
letter
and
used
it
for
her
business
without
my
knowledge
my
cousin
asked
me
to
be
a
bridesmaid
for
her
this
made
really
happy
because
i
was
adopted
into
the
family
and
her
asking
me
made
me
realise
that
she
saw
me
as
a
cousin
and
not
just
another
person
there
were
other
cousins
she
could
have
asked
but
she

main
disgust

i
was
teased
by
my
friend
for
not
scoring
good
marks

exams
i
bought
an
aquarium
which
made
me
much
pleasure
i
was
watching
the
fish
when
my
father
came
in
and
asked
me
how
much
i
had
payed
for
it
he
said
he
would
not
pay
for
the
current
that
it
would
requirea
girl
whom
i
trusted
and
with
whom
i
had
shared
personal
,
confidential
matters
twisted
the
facts
and
told
it
to
a
common
friend
of
ours
when
this
common
friend
told
me
the
version
my
friend
had
told
her
,
i
was
angry
i
had
to
decline
an
appointment
which
had
been
very
important
for
the
other
person

this
reason

dated
another
boy
several
times
,
when
i
was
still
going
with
my
former
boyfriend
this
made
me
feel
a
little
bit
guilty
towards
my
friend
several
days
after
my
final
examination
at
school
,
i
was
sitting
in
an
airplane
on
my
way
to
greece
i
enjoyed
that
moment
very
muchwhen
i
shot
a
bird
in
the
head
with
a
shotgun
being
bored
in
school
,
not
being
able
to
marry
and
have
childrenwe
where
in
a
bar
and
my
friend
had
a
fight
with
some
guys
who
were
in
the
table
aside
a
few
months
ago
when
i
was
teaching
,
i
suddenly
became
very
angry
at
the
children
and
slapped
some
of
themi
'
m
afraid
of
driving
on
the
special
seat
of
a
mororcycle
,
mainly
with
certain
colleagues
who
by
exces
of
self
confidence
drive
beyond
limits
or
measure
in
the
traffic
and
the
main
victim
is
always
the
person
who
sits
behind
the
driver
getting
lost
in
a
strange
placeafter
having
at
last
finished
my
master
'
s
thesis
,
i
felt
great
joy
and
relief
i
had
been
haunted
by
the
thesis
during
the
whole
of
my
studies
when
i
had
to
talk
to
some
strangers
,
from
whom
i
was
expecting
a
negative
answerwhen
i
didn
'
t
meet
an
appointment
i
had
made
the
person
phoned
me
but
i
thought
of
something
(
i
told
i
was
ill
)
so
that
i
didn
'
t
have
to
go
when
someone
whom
i
trusted
,
disappointed
me
terriblyone
day
,
early
morning
my
mother
who
is
healthy
fell
ill
there
was
no
doctor
or
compounder
near
by
and
for
a
few
hours
8
a
m
to
6
p
m
she
did
not
speak
a
single
sentence
,
nor
did
she
drink
water
or
milk
there
was
no
movement
in
her
body
and
i
felt
really
scared
i
almost
lost
my
confidence
about
her
survival
i
get
irritated
with
my
son
when
he
screams
or
is
sick
all
over
his
clean
clothesa
friend
of
mine
got
encouragement
and
i
did
not
,
as
the
supervisor
did
not
like
me
disgust
no
maybe
it
is
more
precise
to
say
revultion
at
a
worm
or
a
snake
but
i
mean
it
in
a
social
aspect
when
somebody
had
behaved
like
a
scoundrel
to
you
,
when
by
his
actions
he
has
made
you
change
your
attitude
towards
him
but
i
thing
this
feeling
the
way
i
meant
it
,
is
not
typical
for
the
people
interrelationssending
pictures
home
when
i
'
d
put
on
so
much
weight
when
my
grandmother
died
i
had
a
stronger
relation
to
her
than
to
my
motheri
was
working
at
a
certain
place
and
everyday
after
work
dad
would
come
to
pick
me
up
one
day
he
did
not
come
,
it
started
getting
very
dark
and
i
had
no
money
on
me
and
my
home
was
very
,
very
far
away
whenever
my
father
smokes
the
smell
makes
me
feel
very
uncomfortable
he
never
listens
to
my
complaints
and
i
curse
him
furiously
in
my
mind
i
cannot
solve
this
problem
by
violence
because
of
traditional
moral
valuesmy
mother
and
my
grandmother
were
talking
about
one
of
my
grandmother
'
s
friends
whom
i
hardly
know
i
gave
some
deprecatory
comments
on
him
whereupon
my
grandmother
told
me
that
the
man
had
died
recently
i
was
neglected
undeservedlyat
my
summer
job
,
nobody
looked
after
me
in
particular
and
i
had
to
learn
all
on
my
own
when
my
brother
bought
me
a
nice
pair
of
shoes
from
south
africaas
the
time
to
get
the
results
drew
near
i
became
more
and
more
anxious
my
friend
called
me
and
said
,
you
have
passed
my
heart
was
full
of
joy
i
felt
it
today
when
the
bus
driver
shouted
rather
indecent
words
at
a
man
without
any
reason
whatsoeverthe
death
of
my
father
made
me
feel
quite
guilty
,
because
my
attitude
towards
him
had
been
cold
and
indifferent
leaving
home
to
move
closer
to
university
as
an
oldest
child
,
this
experience
was
traumatic
for
both
my
parents
and
myselfwhen
i
realized
that
my
girlfriend
,
whom
i
like
,
and
i
were
going
to
separate
once
i
was
stopped
by
the
police
in
spain
,
when
i
had
some
grass
in
my
tobaccowhen
i
was
operated
on
the
knee
and
had
to
go
through
rehabilitation
when
i
was
fined
for
speedingi
suddenly
found
that
those
whom
i
considerered
to
be
my
good
friends
did
not
care
for
me
although
i
could
still
be
with
them
i
felt
unimportant
i
deeply
thought
about
the
reason
behind
this
so
as
to
see
who
was
responsible
for
this
finally
i
made
up
my
mind
and
decided
not
to
expect
too
much
from
them
i
was
sad
when
i
decided
that
they
were
no
longer
my
good
friends
when
i
got
a
good
grade
for
an
exam
in
statisticsmy
class
leader
told
me
i
am
not
chosen
for
your
english
lectures
when
a
patient
in
the
ward
died
(
one
who
had
been
under
my
care
)
i
felt
as
if
i
didn
'
t
give
the
appropriate
care
to
the
patientthe
day
i
was
to
receive
my
gold
medal
for
the
m
a
,
my
grandmother
,
who
i
loved
very
much
,
died
after
an
illness
she
died
a
few
hours
before
the
convocation
while
i
was
attending
the
convocation
i
had
to
control
my
grief
as
she
would
not
have
liked
me
to
miss
it
it
was
a
day
she
had
been
waiting
for
,
but
did
not
get
to
see
when
i
passed
the
12th
standard
board
examsin
the
past
i
experienced
this
feeling
almost
all
the
time
wherever
i
went
,
in
different
sutuations
i
was
small
and
i
had
to
be
taken
to
kindergarten
,
but
me
the
fool
didn
'
t
dare
to
tell
exactly
where
,
finally
as
a
result
i
was
late
when
i
entered
a
toilet
in
a
bar
and
it
stanki
have
high
expectations
for
my
future
but
if
i
pursue
the
subject
in
this
manner
i
will
not
attain
this
this
was
when
the
girl
i
was
in
love
with
accepted
my
proposal
and
everything
went
smoothly
,
just
as
i
had
wanted
it
to
it
was
contrary
to
my
previous
feelings
of
uncertainty
about
her
responsei
had
applied
for
a
job
and
they
had
assured
me
that
the
exams
would
take
place
a
few
months
later
a
week
later
i
went
to
obtain
some
more
information
and
they
told
me
that
the
exams
had
already
taken
place
when
i
was
a
child
i
hid
under
the
sheets
out
of
fear
of
darknessfinding
my
glasses
again
after
having
lost
them
in
town
i
was
hitchhiking
and
was
picked
up
by
a
stranger
he
drove
into
the
woods
and
wanted
to
make
love
with
me
,
i
refused
and
escaped
from
the
car
when
walking
in
the
wood
and
hearing
the
car
i
was
afraidi
felt
happy
when
i
saw
my
brother
at
the
bus
depot
after
3
months
without
seing
each
other
during
a
football
game
i
made
an
offence
towards
an
acquaintance
later
on
this
acquaintance
also
tackeled
me
and
the
game
became
very
rudewhen
i
was
8
years
old
my
tonsils
had
to
be
operated
on
this
is
not
a
complicated
operation
,
but
just
before
it
started
i
was
very
afraid
so
that
i
will
never
forget
it
at
a
party
my
best
girlfriend
got
really
drunk
and
went
off
with
a
guy
she
knows
i
really
likeon
a
dark
night
i
felt
that
there
were
several
people
near
me
and
i
did
not
know
who
they
were
when
i
failed
a
test
at
my
primary
school
i
was
then
in
grade
7
and
we
were
about
to
take
the
main
examwhen
a
close
friend
met
me
at
the
station
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
when
i
came
back
from
a
long
and
tiring
journey
during
a
demonstration
i
climbed
up
the
closed
central
door
of
a
bus
when
the
bus
stopped
i
had
to
go
back
to
the
same
place
,
afraid
that
the
police
would
see
meduring
a
trivial
(
friendly
)
discussion
,
one
of
the
participants
made
an
intervention
which
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
i
read
a
newspaper
report
that
a
little
boy
was
forced
to
look
while
his
sister
was
rapedwhen
i
was
a
child
,
i
heard
the
floor
cracking
and
i
thought
there
was
a
burglar
in
our
house
i
hid
under
the
blanket
and
trembled
i
went
to
see
a
movie
and
i
went
with
a
friend
,
it
was
really
frightening
and
it
made
me
stop
and
think
about
the
world
around
me
and
what
it
is
really
like
out
there
i
was
frightened
all
that
nighti
was
talking
to
a
friend
of
mine
about
our
parents
and
education
i
said
something
and
then
realized
that
i
did
not
know
my
friend
'
s
parents
,
their
motives
and
education
i
felt
ashamed
at
having
talked
about
something
i
did
not
know
anything
about
some
days
ago
i
fell
down
at
a
public
place
,
i
came
into
notice
but
thank
god
i
was
not
mocked
at
though
it
hurt
badly
,
at
the
first
moment
i
felt
shame
,
not
achewhen
i
realized
that
i
avoided
two
good
friends
with
whom
i
always
shared
toys
and
sorrows
i
made
up
idle
stories
to
avoid
telling
them
what
happened
to
me
my
sister
forgot
to
bring
presents
for
my
birthday
,
i
was
rude
to
herwhen
i
was
not
chosen
to
go
to
your
english
lectures
going
to
the
examn
not
well
preparedfamily
member
survived
an
operation
when
my
mother
diedi
went
home
all
alone
from
a
restaurant
it
was
dark
,
i
went
very
fast
behind
me
,
there
were
some
drunk
men
who
shouted
at
me
by
chance
,
i
met
some
friends
who
accompanied
me
i
lead
a
rather
secure
life
the
only
thing
i
can
remember
is
a
song
from
the
nineteenth
century
which
is
against
alcohol
both
the
melody
and
the
word
(
although
naive
)
effected
my
emotionswhen
i
stole
a
book
in
class
and
the
teacher
caught
me
,
the
rest
of
the
class
laughed
at
my
attempt
in
a
bus
i
fell
sick
and
vomitted
in
a
bag
the
entire
situation
was
disgusting
in
itselfto
have
a
friend
who
i
didn
'
t
see
for
months
,
and
under
the
circumstances
that
i
met
him
made
me
feel
happy
,
and
perhaps
because
it
has
been
one
of
the
good
things
that
i
learned
with
this
friend
when
i
worked
at
the
life
saving
service
i
was
disgusted
by
a
patient
whose
outward
appearance
was
distastefulpracticing
wind
surf
my
body
was
caught
under
the
sail
on
trying
to
get
out
my
leg
was
caught
in
the
lashing
i
was
afraid
of
dying
by
asphixia
when
i
lost
my
study
grant
without
having
attended
any
exam
in
the
career
i
had
started
,
and
it
was
too
late
to
cancel
my
registrationwhen
i
began
dansing
,
the
teacher
came
and
told
me
that
i
was
very
good
and
would
soon
get
into
the
ballet
academy
missing
lectures
and
avoiding
university
work
for
no
reason
when
it
had
to
be
donemy
grandmother
died
i
was
making
very
strong
statements
about
infidelity
in
couples
then
i
discovered
that
one
of
my
best
friends
,
who
had
just
been
through
a
very
sad
case
of
mutual
infidelity
,
was
listeningwhen
i
applied
for
the
college
entrance
examination
to
fuvest
,
and
i
wasn
'
t
approved
in
the
second
fase
i
felt
this
when
i
was
copying
homework
for
one
of
my
classesi
greeted
a
friend
and
he
did
not
respond
when
i
entered
the
dissecting
room
for
the
first
time
i
think
i
felt
disgusted
mainly
because
of
the
bad
smell
of
formalinewhen
an
argument
with
a
friend
of
mine
over
our
behaviour
towards
another
friend
turned
into
a
quarrel
i
lost
my
temper
and
nearly
knocked
him
out
i
feel
afraid
of
the
way
a
great
friend
looks
at
me
,
and
also
a
little
afraid
of
the
directions
that
it
'
s
goingthe
same
as
in
shame
my
father
promoted
to
be
a
professoron
the
train
a
drunk
person
touched
my
baby
and
i
reacted
very
disapprovingly
i
felt
ashamed
later
as
the
person
had
not
been
aggressive
though
he
could
have
been
when
one
'
s
studies
seem
hopelessly
difficult
and
uninterestingonce
i
did
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
a
coffee
when
the
train
taking
me
to
my
military
service
left
the
station
,
on
the
platform
remained
relatives
,
projects
and
goodtimes
i
had
a
hard
year
aheadlast
course
,
when
i
passed
with
good
marks
three
subjects
which
i
had
previously
failed
i
felt
it
when
i
received
a
letter
telling
that
i
had
been
classified
in
a
national
concourse
of
p
i
felt
happy
and
vanity
about
itonce
in
my
homes
yard
,
i
was
plaing
football
with
my
cousin
and
in
a
certain
quick
the
ball
went
on
uncontrolled
putting
down
a
bird
cage
,
killing
it
i
felt
guilty
of
revealing
a
secret
to
my
in
law
i
told
her
that
my
brother
and
i
had
gone
to
disconight
which
is
a
thing
my
brother
didn
'
t
want
to
let
her
know
later
my
brother
was
accused
of
spending
a
night
outwhen
it
appeared
that
i
was
not
pregnant
when
i
was
several
weeks
overtime

had
a
test
in
the
class
and
i
had
not
adequately
prepared
myself
i
didn
'
t
fare
so
well
on
the
exam
and
i
felt
bad
about
itwhen

me
borrow
some
money

winter
,
after
my
grant
was
spent

was
asked
to

purposes
since
the
condition
was
already
bad
,
the
child
died
as
soon
as
i
finished
the
procedure
a
colleague
of
mine
asked
a
lecturer
to
put
him
a
higher
mark
in
order
to
keep
his
good
mards
and
thus
to
continue
getting
a
scholarship
for
an
excellent
gradei
get
angry
when
someone
imputes
on
me
things
i
never
can
do

naturally
negative
servility
,
connections
,
impudence
,
traits
that
get
me
mad
when
i
get

this
makes
me
angrywhen
a
drunkard

at
me
saying
that
i
was
a
prostitute

was
not
given
a
chance
to

to
my
close
relatives
as
to
why
i
could
not
go
to
visit
them
when
they
were
ill
when
i
did
go

they
thought
that
i
had
been
selfish
and
irresponsible
during
their
illnesswhen
i
was
8
years
old
,
i
would
usually
come
home
from
school
with
my
mother
in
a
car

the
first
time

pointed
out
a
loop
hole
in
the
committee
'
s
administration
he
could
not
suggest
any
improvements
,
so
i
quarrelled
with
him
when

caught
in

pouring
rain

thursday
and
did
not
have
a
raincoat

was
quite
uneasy
and
i
felt
i
didn

manage
when
i
found
out
that
someone
close
to
me
was
flirting
aroundafter
each
successfully

happy
when
i
met
a
good

had
a
quarrel
but
after
two
weeks
i
was
really
glad
to
see
him

now
i
am

got
to
know
about
the
reaction
of
a
friend
of
mine
in
a
certain
situation
i
had
not
expected
him
to
react
that
waywhen
the
committee

i
belong
,
was
accused
of
having
squandered
the
money
of

worked
came
in
and
asked
if
the
goods
that
he
had
ordered

had
totally
forgotten
about
this
order
and
i
tried
to
offer
weak
excuseswhen
i
met
again
a
great
friend
and
talked
a
little
while
with
him
when
i
see
again

of
breaking

not
knowing
anyone
when
i
was
admitted
to
a
language
school
on
the
day
when
i
was
informed
by
a
message
and
my
parents
congratulated
mea
drunken
friend
of
mine
was
beating
up
another
friend
,
who
was
also
drunk
i
feel
sadness
from
the
fact
that
i
was
not
born
with
a
better
appearancei
have
a
girlfriend
,
who
is
almost
like
a
daughter
to
me
she
is
studying
out
of
station
and
i
get
to
see
her
only
once
a
year
her
arrival
is
always
a
joyous
one
finding
out
that
my
best
friend
could
not
go
to
universityfinding
out
my
name
on
the
list
for
english
lectures
getting
a
letter
from
a
friend
who
did
not
write
for
a
long
timearguing
with
a
friend
over
politics
she
was
more
informed
on
the
issues
and
made
me
feel
very
ashamed
of
my
political
ignorance
when
my
uncle
diedemptied
a
bucket
of
water
in
a
hospital
as
an
evening
class
teacher
i
got
positive
feedback
when
the
atmosphere
is
good
and
a
kind
of
relaxed
understanding
existsmy
son
'
s
mother
told
me
that
she
wanted
to
move
to
vienna
and
take
the
child
with
her
this
means
a
rather
long
distance
for
me
my
whole
family
was
sad
and
dumbfounded
so
that
my
own
feelings
were
intensified
when
i
was
reading
a
book
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
book
itself
but
with
the
disagreable
smell
of
the
pages
of
the
bookforgot
to
give
a
present
to
my
little
nephew
when
i
got
grade
c
in
m160
at
the
end
of
my
first
year
at
unza
i
had
expected
a
c
or
a
b
as
m160
is
easy
,
going
by
my
capacity
in
mathematicswhen
one
of
my
best
friends
commited
siucide
during
these
holidays
when
i
confessed
to
my
girl
friend
(
now
my
wife
)
that
i
had
betrayed
her
with
another
womani
am
disgusted
with
a
nieghbour
who
is
looking
for
all
sorts
of
quarrel
with
my
parents
and
me
he
feels
we
are
hampering
his
living
close
to
us

has

he
provoked
me
several
times
till
i
reacted
in

no
disastrous
consequences

appearence
was
also
antihygienically

caused
me
disgust
but
i
ate

out
with
my
family

guy
called
and
said
,
in
effect
,
that
i
was
nice
and
he
liked
me
hence
the
emotional
joy
a
friend
catched
me
while
masturbating
i
am
not
fully
sure
whether
she
saw
it
or
noti

my
cousin
badly
after
she
threw
away

dresses
in
a
pit

brother
was
beaten
by
his
friendsthe
government
'
s
announcement
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
student
allowances
in
1984
when
my
boyfriend
was
leaving
to
go
home
one
night
,
i
had
a
very
deep
sense
of
uneasiness
and
an
unwarranted
fear
that
i
wouldn
'
t
see
him
againi
was
walking
from
my
friend
'
s
house
,
a
few
blocks
from

house
,
when

to
follow
me
he
waited
i
passed
by
it
rotateed
a
little
and
stopped
on
my
way
i
changed
completely
my
way
and
the
car
went
on
following
me
until
i
turned
at
a
corner
and
running
i
hid
in
a
garden
of
a
house
,
waiting
for
the
car
to
pass
by
i
went
back
home
terribly
afraid
when
i
almost
did
something
awful
with
a
friend
of
mine
and
myselfwhen
i
got
into
an
argument
with
someone
and
was
very
abusive
,
but
they
were
a
close
friend
and
i
later
regretted
it
my
grades
when
my
parents
say
,
how
are
you
doing
at
school
,
getting
good
grades
?
i
say
,
great
,
just
fine
!
actually
,
i
feel
ashamed
about
myselfwhen
my
friend
needed
my
help
very
much
and
i
,
at
that
moment
,
made
an
end
to
our
relationship
when
i
knew
that
they
would
not
give
me
a
transfer
from
one
university
to
another
i
began
to
insult
the
educatioon
authorities
and
the
government
,
i
ended
up
at
the
doorwhen
i
entered
university
when
i
failed
an
examthe

boyfriend
appeared
at
home
with
a
pair
of
rings
for
our
wedding

didn
'
t
like
my
former
fob

felt
joy
when
i
received
a
telegram
offering
me
a
new
one
that
i
though
better
and
for
which
i
had
been
waitinga
female

which
were
for
the
homework
and
not
social

were
very
busy
and
the
deadline
was
close
but
we
had
to
waste
half
an
hour
or
an
hour
waiting
for
her
as
we
could
do
nothing
else
then
i
saw
someone
that
i

not
like
to
be
around
alcoholicsi
gave
my
mom
a
gift

whenever
i
put
myself
in
other
'
s
shoes
and
try
to
make
the
person
happy
,
comfort
him
or
make
friends
and
i
am
misunderstood
and
rejected
,
especially
when
this
person
is
a
family
member
or
a
frienda
person
close
to
me
told
me
that
his
positive
regard
depended
on
my
conduct
when
my
grandmother
came
to
stay
with
us
permanently
as
she
is
a
very
difficult
person
to
stay

known
the

a
few
months
when

proposed
to

my
brother
took
some
slimy
substance
swimming
on

and
threatened
to
throw
it
at
me

it
when

came
home
after
the
examination
session
and
i
said
i
had

talks
with
indecent
words
i
was
the
compere
at

party
and
all
my
efforts

immobile
,
non
co
operative
guests
i
felt
frustation
bordering
on
angeri

above
condition
when
i
was
found
in

i
was
unable

my
boyfriend
we
played
games
and
talked
all
eveningi
went
to
the
cinema
with
my
friends
,
without
telling
my
mother
about
it
as
i
had
been
to
the
cinema
the
day
before
also
when
she
asked
me
where
i
had
been
,
i
lied
when
my
grandmother
died
of
cancerbefore
christmas
i
got
to
know
a
girl
but
our
relationshop

not
consolidate
before

holiday
therefore
it
was
a
big
surprise
to
get
a
carefully
hand
made
present
from
her
our
relationship
grew
closer
i
wanted
to
get
in
contact
with
a
girl
i
loved
,
but
i
was
afraid
she
would
refuse
mewhen
the
girl
whom
i
have
lusted
after
expressed
reciprocal
feelings
and
then
days
later
changed
her
mind
a
child
told
me
she
had
been
sexually
abused
by
her
step
father
i
only
knew
the
child
and
had
not
come
into
contact
with
either
parent
i
tried
to
do
what
was
best
for
the
child
the
event
and
the
stepfather
disgusted
mewhen
i
watched
tv
and
saw
a
performance
of
prince
(
a
popidol
)
disgusting
he
'
d
better
be
a
stallion
when
my
first
boyfriend
left
me
i
tried
not
to
let
him
understand
i
felt
miserablewhen
i
am
alone
in
a
room
with
no
contact
with
anyone
loneliness
drains
me
i
had
promised
to
say
goodbye
to
a
person
who
was
going
on
a
trip
,
and
i
did
not
turn
upa
horse
which
i
had
liked
very
much
was
taken
away
someone
signed
up
for
a
workshift
at
the
co
op
where
i
live
and
she
did
not
want
to
work
the
switchboard
i
became
very
angry
she
had
mentioned
earlier
that
she
wanted
and
needed
the
workshift
to
me
so
i
did
not
sign
upi
was
worried
by
a
task
related
to
my
studies
which
had
to
be
done
in
groups
of
two
i
was
talking
about
it
to
my
friends
when
i
said
something
negative
,
in
too
abrupt
a
manner
,
concerning
my
work
partner
i
did
not
quite
mean
what
i
said
and
i
felt
ashamed
at
having
been
mean
enough
to
criticize
him
as
he
is
also
a
friend
of
mine
i
was
very
sad
when
i
heard
that
my
brother
had
failed
the
standard
8
exams
for
the
third
timeovereating
a
traditional
type
of
food

pudding
when
approached
by
a
gang
of
youths
in
town
at
nighti
get
disgusted
with
the
inherent
racist
attitudes
of
my
brother
in
law
in
putting
down
various
ethnic
groups
and
also
my
unwillingness
to
challenge
him
about
these
attitudes
in
order
to
keep
the
peace
a
few
days
back
,
i
walked
on
a
heap
of
faeces
while
walking
on
the
road
i
got
goose
flesh
because
of
thisnot
succeeding
in
a
cross
country
skiing
competition
,
which
i
intended
to
win
because
i
was
lazy
and
unthoughtful
i
did
not
get
into
contact
with
a
very
close
friend
when
she
shifted
from
the
gold
coast
to
brisbane
,
for
a
month
,
despite
her
efforts
to
contact
me
i
felt
shamed
when
i
finally
confronted
her
againon
a
camp

and
girls
in
one
cabin
one
guy
forced
himself
upon
another
girl
and
was
having
intercourse
,
while
the
girl
in
the
bunk
beneath
was
pretending
to
be
asleep
and
not
be
ill
this
situation
happened
when
my
friend
me
with
a

i
stole
from

observed
how

by
cheating

foreigners
i
e
non
swedish
speaking
my
anger
had
nothing
to
do
with
hatred
against
foreigners
,
but
it
was
an
expression
of
the
anger
i
feel
when
i
see
people
being
usedi
felt
it
when
i
was
at
home

i
thought
the
child
would
realise
that
it

did
not
and
he
put
it
in
his
mouth
when

one
night

i
have
to
wait
half
an
hour
for
the
next
oneat
an
unjust
,
or
to
be
more
precise
,
at
a
bureaucratic
treatment
of
one

personality
when
the
gear
broke
on
my
carit
was
when
my
instructor
awoke
me

a
young

fawning
on

driving
close
behind

the
facial
expressions
of
the
policemen

seemed
to
be
enjoying
themselveswhen

middle
child

told
me
that
she
would
go
to
travel
next

t
talk
this
out
when

this
made
me
happy
they
are
my
closest
friends
and
we
had
not
seen
each
other
for
a
long
time
when
i
almost
drowned
myself

municipal
swimming
pool

i
use
to
go
almost
not
excapingsitting
in
the
dorm
when
the
guys
were
verbally
reading
letters
in

and
the
teacher
asked
me
the
reason
for
my
absencemy
son
passed
grade
7
and
was
accepted
for
form
i
i
went
to
a
lecture

once
again
it

been
cancelled
,
this
was
the
second
time
one
had
a
negative
attitude
towards
the
lecturera
conflict
with
a
pupil
and
there
were
probatory
teachers
present
i
vividly
remember
having
feelings
of
disgust
toward
some
of
my
jr
high
classmates
who
didn
'
t
work
at
all
on
their
schoolwork
and
who
would
coplain
and
take
my
tax
money
when
i
was
older
and
more
successful
than
they
were
at
the
time
i
pictured
some
adults
like
this
that
i
knew
in
the
complaining
situationwhen
i
had
to
sleep
in
a
bed
at
a
hostel

full
of
dirt
when
the
summer
holiday
job
was
almost
overi
felt
sad
after
having
had
an
argument
with
my
boyfriend
i
felt
that
he
did
not
understand
me
and
that
there
was
no
point
in
carrying
on
with
the
relationship
sleeping
through
crew
practice
one
monday
morningi
had
decided
to
propose
to
the
man
i
liked
to
make
a
trip
together
one
day
,
during
breakfast
i
told
him
my
idea
i
was
afraid
of
his
not
accepting
it
and
that
the
idea
would
end
up
as
a
failure
when
my
relatives
troubled
me
so
that
i
would
help
them
financiallywhen
i
was
9
years
old
,
i
got
a
cat
,
but
after
3
days
he
died
i
was
very
sad
,
because
i
had
nursed
him
and
taken
him
to
the
veterinary
'
s
but
in
vain
although
i
had
had
him
only
for
a
short
time
i
had
liked
him
very
much
when
an
unpleasant
person
tried
to
make
friends
with
me
a
subtle
,
small
,
insignificant
,
grey
being
whose
helplessness
and
neutrality
evoked
the
feeling
of
disgust

some
people

so
angry

my
mind
was
to

had
the
feeling
that
she

going
out
with
me
only
because
of
my
defectwhen
i
had
drunk
too
much
and
nearly
got
an

bit

person
my
partner

most
of
the
time
at
the
bar
i
had
little
opportunity
to
get
to
know
people
because
our
table
was
separated
and
my
boyfriend
'
s
parents
were
present
peepingwhen
thieves
broke
into
my
house
at
night
and
held
my

and
me
on
gun
point
for
at
least
ten
minutes
and
took
away
a
lot
of
property
i
had
been
on
friendship
with
a
certain
girl
for
sometime
and
the
love
was
going
on
well
,
but
it
happened
that
i
made
the
friendship
come
to
an
end
suddenly
without
good
reasonswhen
i
noticed
obvious
marks
of
old
age
(
in
a
negative
sense
)
on
a
close
relative
of
mine
almost
had
a
bicycle
accidentsaw
some
young
people
fighting
for
seats
on
a
bus
when
i
was
giving
private
tutorials
to
my
student
he
would
not
concentrate
and
was
lazy
he
had
not
done
the
home
work
that
i
had
assigned
and
his
academic
level
was
very
low
it
was
a
nuisancethis
was
when
i
was
being
followed
home
every
day
from
the
campus
,
by
a
stranger
he
would
follow
me
to
the
campus
and
then
sit
outside
my
class
if
i
was
not
there
he
would
ask
my
friends
as
to
where
i
was
he
was
a
dark
,
ominous
looking
person
and
i
was
terrified
of
him
as
i
did
not
know
his
intentions
i
reported
him
to
the
security
officer
,
who
turned
him
over
to
the
police
i
was
even
more
petrified
then
i
once
felt
guilty
when
a
certain
passenger
in
the
same
(
ship
,
plane
?
)
which
i
boarded
when
coming
from
home
lost
his
10t
which
in
fact
fell
into
my
pocket
unknowinglyone
day
i
went
for
a
bath
i
took
off
my
clothes
and
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
my
brother
came
in
i
felt
sad
and
i
found
no
reason
why
he
came
in
i
felt
guilty
one
day
when
i
stole
a
slice
of
bread
in
a
cafeteriai
went
to
see
a
friend
there
were
other
people
,
too
,
and
everybody
brought
some
present
i
was
the
onlyone
who
brought
nothing
my
friend
was
very
hospitable
and
did
not
show
anything
although
i
knew
how
he
felt
when
i
found
out
i
had
passed
all
of
my
university
examsi
was
at
the
corner
shop
,
which
i
patronise
regularly
i
had
only
a
50
note
and
i
purchased
about
3
worth
of
goods
that
i
really
needed
the
keeper
made
sarcastic
remarks
to
others
about
people
using
him
to
cash
notes
when
someone
took
my
writing
materials
yet
i
was
to
write
examinations
in
a
few
minutesmy
friend
and
i
had
offended
our
classmate
unintenionally
we
wanted
to
apologize
to
her
so
we
decided
to
visit
her
we
knew
that
she
was
stubborn
so
we
were
frightened
when
we
rang
her
door
bell
,
our
fear
was
at
it
'
s
climax
i
borrowed
my
classmate
'
s
notebook
one
week
before
the
examination
and
i
promised
to
give
it
back
to
her
in
two
days
time
i
was
very
busy
at
that
time
and
forgot
many
things
as
i
was
not
very
often
at
home
she
could
not
contact
me
when
i
started
my
revision
i
realized
that
her
notebook
had
been
on
my
desk
for
five
days
i
contacted
her
immediately
and
gave
it
back
to
her
though
she
did
not
say
anything
i
felt
very
guiltyat
work
being
shifted
to
another
area
the
first
time
i
saw
a
pornographic
film
,
all
that
in
practice
is
so
beautiful
but
on
the
screen
appered
as
something
mechanical
,
irrational
,
disgusting
and
dehumanizingi
am
disgusted
with
my
sister
'
s
husband
on
an
early
sunday
morning
after
having
knocked
at
my
door
,
he
suddenly
rushed
in
and
finching
me
still
in
bed
he
began
quarrelling
about
something
i
could
not
understand
i
heard
his
last
words
don
'
t
stare
at
me
so
because
i
'
ll
beat
you
in
your
bed
i
got
up
terrified
and
a
thrashing
followed
always
,
and
this
happens
often
when
i
do
not
keep
my
wordwhen
i
could
not
do
anything
because
of
a
bad
back
when
i
did
something
wrong
in
the
past
and
denied
having
done
it
when
asked
about
it

my
regret

great
i
was
beside

unexpectedly

calmly
solved

was
glad
at
the
possibility
to
be
with
himi

not

my
grandfather
died
when
i
heard
about
his
death
,
i
had
a
bad
feeling
in
my
stomach
and

lost
something
very
precious
on
the
way
home
one
friday
night
in
the
heavy
rain

father
'
s
mother
which

was
unable
to
attend
her
funerali
have
never
felt
this
emotion
on
a
road
trip
with
a
group
of
sorority
and
fraternity
people
,
i
became
intoxicated
and
basically
raped
i
don
'
t
remember
the
actual
event
,
but
i
know
the
feeling
that
i
experienced
lateri
spent
a
weekend
in
san
diego
visiting
my
boyfriend
rob
we
were
at
the
airport
and
my
plane
was
just
about
so
leave
after
saying
goodbye
,
i
boarded
the
plane
it
was
the
hardest
thing
to
do
and
it
was
a
sad
trip
home
had
started
a
relationship
and
did
nothing
to
keep
it
up
,
partly
the
use
of
another
personi
received
the
message
that
i
'
d
been
accepted
at
the
school
where
i
really
wanted
to
go
when
i
had
come
home
drunk
the
day
after
a
party
,
i
felt
very
ashamed
in
front
of
my
parentsi
feel
disgusted
at
people
who
talk
negatively
about
a
person
without
knowing
the
person
well
suddenly
met
someone
in
the
biology
building
at
nightit
was
more
that
fear
anguish
that
i
felt
before
my
last
exam
i
experienced
long
ago
when
i
was
sightseeing
bulgarians
in
a
foreign
languageone
night
,
when
i
got
out
from
the
university
i
saw
two
strange
people
near
my
car
when
i
got
near
,
they
moved
away
,
and
then
came
close
again
i
had
a
feeling
that
they
were
assaulters
after
i
left
i
discovered
that
the
windshield
was
broken
i
broke
a
glass
of
glycerine
at
the
z
c
b
c
store
in
ndolai
was
told
to
do
something
i
did
not
want
to
do
a
fear
from
the
loss
of
a
close
friend
as
a
result
of
his
behaviorwhen
i
saw
a
dog
which
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
car
i
made
a
long
distance
call
to
people
rather
close
to
me
and
i
thought
about
the
sad
incident
that
had
happened
to
them
in
the
near
past
i
knew
that
they
were
thinking
about
it
too
when
i
made
the
callmy
father
had
an
operation
which
lasted
for
hours
we
were
all
very
worried
but
it
was
successful
when
a
close
friend
drowned
in
the
american
riverwhile
i
was
pushing
a
court
roller
out
of
a
ditch
,
i
slipped
and
fell
down
and
the
roller
rolled
back
towards
me
down
slope
it
is
a
miracle
that
i
still
have
my
legs
intact
when
others
let
me
down
,
fail
to
keep
agreementsi
don
'
t
remember
about
a
situation
when
i
have
experienced
this
feeling
maybe
it
was
when
i
saw
a
drunkard

the
street

mine

birth
to
a

that

would
take
some
action
against
me
,
when
i
realized
this
i
approached
him
and
told
him
that
i

i
was
sad

i
was

,
one
day
in

we
fell
sick
and
ended

vomitting
on
each
other
i
experienced
joy
at
a
friend
'
s
22nd
birthday
party
we
had
good
food
,
good
liquid
,
good
company
,
good
music
,
and
an
overall
warm
atmosphere
the
birthday
girl
and
i
communicate
incredibly
well
i
felt
very
content
,
warm
and
inspired
just
talking
with
her
giving
her
a
neck
massagei
suffered
from
a
gynaecological
illness
i
was
quite
displeased
to
hear
that
my
roommates
had
talked
about
it
and
they
had
misrepresented
the
truth
i
felt
deeply
hurt
when
i
learned
that
it
was
done
by
a
good
acquaintance
of
mine
yesterday
my
boyfriend
and
i
wanted
to
play
billiards
however
there
were
boys
playing
(
5
times
)
my
boyfriend
then
is
fed
up
and
chagrined
in
such
case
i
think
it
is
my
faultwhen
i
feel
i
must
be
with
somebody
,
to
talk
with
somebody
but
i
am
alone
i
ran
a
race
for
the
cal
track
team
and
i
did
terribly
and
then
the
coach
said
that
i
should
sit
out
for
the
season
i
felt
really
sad
because
i
wasn
'
t
going
to
be
able
to
run
it
was
something
i
always
had
done
and
now
i
couldn
'
t
do
it
anymoremy
father
got
a
slight
heart
attack
after
a
telephone
call
of
mine
i
did
not
attend
a
social
studies
observation
class
for
1
whole
week
(
i
am
a
student
trainee
teacher
)
anyway
the
other
teachers
thought
this
was
okay
because
the
teacher
i
was
supposed
to
observe
was
not
well
liked
the
teacher
was
in
fact
really
nice
to
me
but
i
wanted
to
get
out
of
teaching
a
hard
topic
he
had
given
mei
felt
a
physical
fear
,
if
i
can
call
it
this
way
,
today
,
in
the
bus
where
i
was
sitting
on
the
first
seat
while

and
whose
driver

person
of
the
opposite
sex
and
was
rejectedwhen
my
grandfather
died
telling
a
lie
to
wife
over
phone
about
what
i
had
been
working
atsome
people
whom
i
do
not
like
at
all
,
and
one
of
the
reasons
is
their
physical
appearance
when
people
around
me
did
not
understand
me
the
right
waywhen
the
n
z
rugby
union
announced
that
they
would
proceed
with
a

couldn
'
t
see
her
she
held
my
shoulders
standing
behind
me
one

given
by
a
male
member
of
the
orchestra
my
feelings
towards
him
were
not
very
deep
,
but
his
feelings
were
i
felt
guilty
when
he
said
i
am
not
a
radiator
before
knowing
my
marks

was
not
sure
that

done
anything
wrongi
remember
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
broke
a
swiss
dinner
set
quite
involuntarily

perhaps
because

to
study
a
lot
and
i
am
shut
up
in
my
appartment

happens
in
particular
because
there
is

have
been
picked
up
a
year
ago
but
they
had
postponed
it
eventually
they
decided
on
one
date
and
i
stayed
at

despite
the
fact
that
i
had
other
things
to
do
they
did
not
come
,
nor
did
they
call
and
they
still

the
christmas
holidays

beach

togsin
a
situation
with
my
girlfriend
i
took
a
decision
later
when
i
thought
about
it
,
i
realized
that
it
was
an
erroneous
decision
i
wasn
'
t
able
to
see
my
girlfriend
on
her
birthday
and
because
i
was
late
arriving
home
from
uni
,
i
didn
'
t
phone
her
as
arranged
at
a
certain
time
(
she
rang
in
the
meantime
)when
our
cat
was
killed
in
a
car
accident
i
was
very
angry
at
the
driver
of
the
car
because
he
didn
'
t
take
enough
care
an
invitation
to
spend
5
days
at
the
seaside
with
all
expenses
paidi
found
a
human
treasure
that
i
desired
and
got
immediately
i
didn
'
t
think
about
anything
when
i
touched
him
i
imploded
but
i
am
whole
when
i
pass
exams
,
or
when
a
close
friend
of
mine
recovered
from
an
illness
,
etca
teacher
was
very
blunt
in
his
relation
to
a
child
so
that
the
child
was
very
upset
when
arriving
at
home
a
friend
gave
me
a
lift
and
we
met
a
road
block
he
tried
to
turn
back
when
an
officer
shouted
at
us
to
stop
my
friend
took
a
turn
suddenly
and
the
officer
raised
his
gun
but
by
the
time
we
were
gonethe
juniors
in
our
dormitory
at
school
started
to
complain
and
make
a
lot
of
noise
about
the
duties
assigned
to
them
by
the
prefect
who
was
my
class
mate
and
was
very
cool
and
dull
i
talked
to
my
boyfriend
on
the
phone
when
i
was
in
high
spirits
and
had
a
lot
to
tell
him
i
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
conversation
and
he
did
not
listen
to
me
to
the
extent
that
i
had
anticipatedmy
girlfriend
'
s
results
in
school
had
become
worse
because
i
prevented
her
from
learning
(
we
often
went
out
etc
)
the
first
time
i
slept
at
my
boyfriends
house
and
had
to
walk
down
the
hall
to
the
shower
in
front
of
his
housemates
i
felt
they
were
judging
mea
friend
of
mine
had
said
something
about
not
liking
to
come
to
my
place
just
before
coming
to
my
place
in
the
meanwhile
i
got
to
learn
about
this
from
another
friend
of
mine
and
when
she
arrived
at
my
place
i
really
treated
her
badly
i
was
later
ashamed
of
the
way
i
had
treated
someone
when
the
person
was
at
my
place
when
i
was
in
a
christian
institution
,
sometimes
the
nuns
would
send
back
the
people
who
came
to
visit
us
when
it
was
not
the
visiting
hours
this
disgusted
mei
felt
disgust
when
i
realized
that
i
had
eaten
something
fatty
,
and
vomited
too
much
the
disqualification
of
two
of
my
mates
in
the
military
servicei
saw
a
program
on
t
v
where
they
had
to
saw
a
skull
for
an
operation
when
i
passed
the
driving
test
(
on
the
second
try
)when
i
tried
to
put
up
a
tent
some
years
ago
,
i
was
teased
and
hindered
by
my
cousin
when
i
read
a
lot
and
did
not
remember
anythinga
tailor
ran
away
with
my
skirt
i
was
walking
to
my
car
at
night
and
thought
that
i
was
being
followedwhen
my
friend
(
girl
)
promised
to
help
me
go
to
the
hospital
and
be
examined
by
good
experts
and
she
deceived
me
when
i
saw
several
people
washing
their
car
with
water
from
a
draini
came
home
from
a
party
rather
drunk
i
said
things
i
would
never
have
said
normally
next
morning
i
was
terribly
ashamed
about
what
i
had
said
i
was
a
passenger
in
a
jumbo
jet
which
was
accelerating
down
the
runway
and
almost
at
the
point
of
take
off
,
when
the
pilot
suddenly
braked
and
put
the
engines
into
reverse
thrust
,
in
an
obviously
urgent
attempt
to
stop
the
aircraft
the
hostesses
show
signs
of
concern
and
my
first
thought
was
that
something
was
on
the
runway
in
our
path
and
that
we
were
in
danger
of
hitting
itreading
a
letter
from
a
close
friend
who
said
he
missed
me
and
cared
for
me
i
had
gone
to
see
one
of
our
professors
about
a
book
,
and
i
did
not
attend
the
class

took
a
few
minutes
laterafter

my
m
a
in
social
sciences
,
i
appeared
for
the
first
semester
exam
i
failed
one
of
the
exams
,
and
when
i
looked
at
my
results
i
felt
disgusted
and
then
i
got
angry
watching
a
horror
filmwhen
i
made
up
with
a
girl
friend
of
mine
after
having
been
on
unfriendly
terms
with
her
(
my
fault
)
i
cried
with
joy
that
evening
my
close
friend
and
i
applied
to
tiss
for
admission

year
,
unfortunately
he
failed
to
get
admission
we
had
done
our
graduation
together
and
are
quite
involved
with
each
other
,
so
we
had
wanted
to
do
our
masters
degree
together
however
,
it
did
not
work
out
as
we
had
expected
it
to
and
this
saddened
memy

playing
at

and
one
of

a
decorative
object
which
was
very
precious
to
me

clutched
a
stranger
(
in
a
rather
intimate
way
)
,
thinking
it

my
boyfriend
when
by
hindsight
i
feel
ashamed
when
thinking
about
it
when
my
mother
slapped
me
in
the
face
,
i
felt
anger
at
that

ashamed
when
my

found
out
that

when

did
not
even
have
the
decency
to
listen
to
him
they
only
asked
him
a
few
questions
half
heartedly
and
then
they
talked

of
their
conversation

against

what
had
made
me
so
late
in
getting

somehow
,
i
felt
i
had
lied
to
them
during
an
argument
between
friends
,
one
of
them
accused
me
of
taking
advantage
of
some
other
friends
who
usually
come
to
the
university
in
my
car
,
saying
that
i

ashamed
of
my
body
in
spite
of
knowing
that
it
is
more
or
less
beautiful
and
also
knowing
that
my
boyfriend
considers
me
beautiful
,
but
this
was
only
in
the
beginning
when
my
boyfriend
asked
me
to
go
out
with
him
and
i
refused
because
i
wanted
to
go
out
with
another
guy
i
did
go
out
and
my
boyfriend
found
outnone

the
part
of

while
preparing
for
a
midterm

i
thought

be
very
hard

decided
that
the

to
me
and
anyhow
,
i
had
known

happen
sooner
or
laterin

was
a
fat

sickly
looking
woman
in

emotionally
involved
with

withone
time
i
felt
guilty
when

,
when
the
servant
asked
whether

that

at
the
funeral
of
my
grand
father
it

sadi
felt
disgust
when
i
received
visitors
at
an
odd
hour
i
was
seriously
preparing
for
examinations
,
so
i
did
not
appreciate
their
coming
i
was
disgusted
with
the
behaviour
of
one
of
my
fellow
students
during
my
secondary
school
life
he
was
a
habitual
noise
maker
and
caused
great
conflicts
with
the
teacherswhen
a
person
the
same
age
as
me
insisted
that
i
call
him
mister
i
refused
to
succumb
,
but
he
persisted
and
i
got
angry
as
he
had
belittled
me
not
keeping
a
promise
of
delivering
materials
of
great
importance
to
the
receivera
honest
sliding
on
the
part
of
a
girlfriend
of
mine
terribly
crossed
i
started
breaking
things
and
tearing
books
it
was
some
years
ago
when
one
evening
some
people
came
home
and
told
us
my
father
was
badly
injured
in
an
accidentmy
girlfriend
sent
me
a
letter
with
a
shiny
picture
in
it
one
day
,
when
i
was
a
child
,
my
grandmother
shut
me
up
in
a
roomwhen
my
girl
told
me
that
she
loved
me
more
than
any
male
creature
on
earth
and
that
i
would
be
the
only
one
in
her
heart
for
all
her
life
when
the
lady
who
is
now
my
wife
accepted
my
proposal
to
be
my
lover
and
future
wifei
dreamt
of
my
father
'
s
death
while
i
was
at
secondary
school
i
was
screaming
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
was
woken
up
by
my
friend
that
day
i
was
really
sad
when
i
woke
up
after
a
nightmarewhen
i
dreamt
that
my
family
was
in
trouble
and
was
facing
many
difficulties
when
i
realised
that
i
had
rejected
a
boy
,
who
was
fallen
in
love
with
me
,
rather
bluntly
four
timesafter
yelling
at
my
girlfriend
,
i
felt
bad
because
she
was
?
crying
and
upset
i
felt
joyful
when
my
boyfriend
met
me
at
the
station
,
while
at
first
he
had
said
that
he
would
not
do
thatwhen
after
having
had
sexual
intercourse
with
a
friend
,
i
thought
that
he
had
told
about
it
to
a
friend
of
his
when
a
girlfriend
left
menot
being
able
to
hand
in
homework
in
time
some
noisy
guests
arrived
at
the
hotel
i
had
been
slightly
irritated
earlier
at
night
when
i
was
trying
to
sleep
they
were
having
a
party
so
i
went
and
yelled
at
them
i
wanted
to
sleep
as
i
had
to
get
up
early
the
next
dayi
feel
ashamed
when
i
am
praised
this
was
when
one
of
the
clinical
officers
scolded
us
in
the
hospital
on
how
to
make
beds
but
we
did
not
deserve
to
be
scoldedone
day
i
addressed
my
husband
in
an
abusive
manner
in
front
of
his
friends
later
on
i
realized
this
myself
and
felt
ashamed
of
myself
when
last
year
in
college
i
received
the
award
best
student
of
the
year
,
i
felt
very
happy
as
i
got
what
i
had
wanted
and
my
wish
had
been
fulfilledwhen
i
think
about
my
parents
getting
old
in
1983
a
sadist
provoked
my
sister
in
my
presence
he
tried
to
force
my
sister
into
accompanying
him
to
his
place
,
but
my
sister
did
not
agree
and
so
she
was
kicked
and
she
fell
down
there
was
a
fighti
overreacted
towards
my
mother
and
felt
ashamed
afterwards
i
had
parked
in
a
corner
,
and
when
i
was
going
out
i
didn
'
t
watch
if
another
car
was
coming
and
went
out
the
car
that
was
coming
was
obliged
to
stop
suddenly
it
didn
'
t
crash
but
for
a
littlewhen
i
was
sick
my
husband
bought
me
a
piece
of
cake
i
threw
away
an
object
,
which
belonged
to
a
friend
,
because
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
my
friend
was
very
sad
about
that
and
i
felt
guiltywhen
i
passed
the
grade
7
exam
my
friend
was
badly
hurtmy
car
had
been
towed
away
by
the
traffic
police
because
it
had
been
wrongly
parked
however
the
sign
had
been
put
up
only
after
i
had
already
parked
having
gone
to
school
without
learning
anything
,
as
usuali
was
very
startled
when
,
at
night
at
2
00
am
,
a
boy
approached
me
and
yelled
i
fuck
you
,
then
however
he
stopped
and
laughed
at
me
my
grandmother
died
,
and
my
mother
called
me
one
sunday
morning
in
the
autumn
the
way
my
mother
told
me
about
it
,
i
hated
her
at
that
moment
she
sounded
as
if
she
had
been
waiting
for
the
death
of
my
grandmother
i
had
lost
a
person
close
to
me
i
felt
guilty
too
as
i
had
been
bad
to
my
grandmother
of
late
i
had
not
remained
calm
when
she
no
longer
understood
everything
so
wellwhen
i
went
in
a
clinical
hospital
and
saw
in
what
conditions
people
are
attended
there
when
i
realized
that
not
all
my
friends
like
the
comments
that
i
pass
in
their
presencewhen
i
found
out
that
my
sister
had
been
playing
with
my
confidential
things
which
she
had
taken
from
my
hand
bag
no
responsea
friend
had
promised
me
to
give
me
a
lift
to
graz
to
be
sure
i
called
her
before
we
went
she
told
me
that
she
had
just
promised
another
person
to
give
him
a
lift
i
was
alone
walking
in
a
deserted
part
of
the
city
and
i
had
some
fear
that
some
men
would
attack
me
and
rob
meone
day
i
went
to
see
a
movie
without
my
parents
permission
it
was
an
adult
movie
and
i
was
scared
that
my
parents
would
not
allow
me
to
see
the
movie
however
after
coming
home
i
felt
very
guilty
at
what
i
had
done
looking
for
the
toilet
in
a
dark
placeone
of
my
friends
and
i
had
breakfast
in
a
restaurant
it
was
spontaneous
and
lots
of
fun
when
someone
tells
me
something
that
hurts
me
,
i
feel
bad
about
it
and
also
feel
sadpolitical
and
military
trnsgressions
around
the
world
,
generally
speaking
this
cannot
be
described
through
this
questionaire
when
some
friends
of
mine
asked
me
to
go
camping
with
them
for
a
fortnightmy
best
friend
started
moving
out
with
my
boyfriend
when
i
heard
this
my
heart
sank
because
i
didn
'
t
expect
that
my
own
good
friend
could
do
such
a
thing
,
so
i
got
angry
at
the
railway
station
,
while
waiting
for
the
last
train
at
night
i
noticed
that
a
drunk
young
man
was
appraching
me
in
a
purposeful
mannneri
had
met
someone
and
we
became
good
friends
our
relationship
grew
closer
and
now
he
is
my
boyfriend
i
felt
joy
when
i
found
out
how
he
felt
about
me
i
had
a
quarrel
with
near
persons
i
said
many
ill
considered
things
and
i
regretted
it
when
it
was

,
i
was

it
started
raining
while
the
sun

experienced
a
feeling
of
joy
,
happiness
and
fulfillment
the
whole
nature
was
full
of
music
after
my
final
examination
at
school
i
was
glad
that
the
examination
was
over
and
that
i
had
passed

km
off
there
was
a
thick
fog
and
snowfall
there
was
not
enough
room
in
the
car
for
all
of
them
and
they
asked
me
to
go
there
once
again
when
i
did
not
do
that
they
had
a
way
to
make
me
feel
guiltyi
was
going
away
,
leaving
a
dear
person
behind
when
finally
i
found
a
place
to
live
,
i
felt
relieved
,
predicting
changes
in
my
life
,
and
i
became
happyi
was
in
a
cafe
with
another
person
when
,
suddenly
,
several
close
friends
of
my
partner
appeared
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
my
partner
felt
uncomfortable
i
moved
to
a
flat
a
friend
who
had
lived
there
before
,
had
left
the
flat
in
a
terrible
mess
i
was
very
angry
about
that
sloppiness
and
impudencewhen
i
masturbated
in
my
room
i
wanted
something
in
particular
and
did
not
get
it
,
also
there
was
no
possibility
of
getting
itwhen
an
uncle
of
mine
who
is
very
ill
started
to
cough
wich
sounded
very
dirty
(
he
can
'
t
help
it
of
course
)
someone
being
arrogant
to
memy
sister
was
impolite
to
my
father
when
the
family
was
having
lunch
together
at
a
restaurant
she
thought
that
our
parents
had
been
prejudiced
against
her
,
this
was
an
extreme
thought
at
a
carneval
party
i
smooched
with
a
man
some
days
later
i
was
rather
ashamed
for
thatwhen
my
grandmother
was
about
80
years
old
,
she
lived
with
us
for
several
years
i
saw
her
illness
i
did
not
even
want
to
breath
the
air
that
smelled
of
her
presence
receiving
a
nice
present
from
my
parentswhen
i
came
again
in
contact
with
a
girl
i
liked
very
much
and
most
important
she
also
liked
me
when
my
mother
was
operatedi
was
angry
this
morning
when
i
missed
the
train
to
university
when
i
was
a
child
,
my
beloved
cat
gave
birth
to
four
beautiful
little
kittens
before
she
had
them
,
she
came
up
to
me
and
i
followed
her
out
,
then
witnessed
them
being
borna
girl
whom
i
hadn
'
t
seen
for
a
period
of
time
told
me
that
she
had
been
pregnant
and
had
an
abortion
i
was
the
father
after
the
death
of
a
girl
who
i
dislikedat
the
crowded
conditions
of
living
i
always
quarrel
with
my
elder
brother
as
he
puts
the
t
v
volume
at
a
deafening
level
and
i
can
not
practise
my
piano
lessons
thus
i
feel
that
my
home
is
disgusting
after
the
car
accident
in
guiltwhile
i
was
waiting
for
them
to
give
me
the
marks
of
the
most
difficult
subject
this
year
a
friend
of
mine
had
sex
with
someone
of
a
different
race
on
a
winnebago
trip
down
to
usc
in
front
of
everyone
(
all
my
friends
embarrassed
my
sorority
house
name
)when
the
literature
teacher
made
me
recite
a
poem
in
the
middle
of
the
class
and
i
had
to
gesticulate
during
a
summer
holiday
a
french
girl
and
i
had
becoe
back
home
,
i
felt
very
sadwhen
i
saw
a
film
where
a
black
was
rapeing
a
girl
while
another
one
was
filming
it
for
a
pornographic
movie
i
had
had
a
farewell
party
at
the
place
where
i
had
been
working
for
a
year
that
night
i
could
not
fall
off
to
sleep
i
was
sad
thinking
that
i
would
not
see
my
nice
fellow
workers
againwhen
my
father
thought
that
i
was
an
unrelaible
son
once
i
had
to
clean
a
lavatory
which
was
obstructed
it
was
in
a
friend
'
s
country
house
and
there
was
nobody
there
to
help
mestopped
at
a
fast
food
shop
with
friends
and
a
few
locals
wanted
to
fight
us
for
no
apparent
reason
they
hit
and
picked
on
one
of
my
friends
in
the
university
we
were
convoked
to
a
stroll
like
a
freshman
i
was
still
innocent
about
the
manipulation
on
seeing
the
goal
of
the
exaltation
to
poor
character
people
,
i
felt
anger
on
feeling
myself
mass
of
maneuverwhen
i
had
a
good
result
in
the
certificate
examination
not
collecting
homeworks
in
time
to
give
the
teacherwhen
my
grandfather
died
,
i
saw
my
grandmother
crying
against
my
aunt
'
s
shoulder
(
i
had
never
seen
my
grandmother
cry
before
)
on
days
when
i
feel
close
to
my
partner
and
other
friends
when
i
feel
at
peace
with
myself
and
also
experience
a
close
contact
with
people
whom
i
regard
greatlywhen
my
brother
was
held
up
and
robbed
the
carterer
refused
to
give
me
sugar
to
add
to
my
tea
saying
that
there
was
no
sugar
whilst
it
was
there
,
so
i
left
the
cafe
disgusted
without
taking
the
teawhen
i
promised
a
male
friend
of
mine
to
visit
him
,
and
did
not
when
a
close
relative
is
treated
badlywhen
i

and
didn

t
discuss
the
way
he
had
achieved
this
positioni
got
into
a
bad
fight
in
a
bar
and
my
friend
received
a
bad
cut
above
his
left
eye
while
trying
to
separate
us
when
i
embarrassed
a
friend
by
asking
him
aloud
if
a
certain
person
was
the
source
of
gossip
he
told
me
about
,
while
that
person
was
also
presenti
was
living
in
rooms
in
a
very
lonely
,
quiet
neigbourhood
during
the
night
it
was
very
silent
and
this
frightened
me
the
fact
of
being
alone
in
that
house
frightened
me
the
headmistress
at
a
secondary
school
accused
me
of
banging
the
classroom
door
when
i
didn

t
in

of
the
whole
classviewing
the
nuclear
war
film
threads
when
i
got
a
message
that
i
was
employed
as
a
nurse
at
a
kindergartenthe
thought
that
i
'
ll
never
sit
at
the
school
desk
again
,
caused
a
deep
grief
at
the
end
of
my
eleventh
form
my
friend
often
played
a
joke
on
me
and
sometimes
i
thought
that
he
was
a
nonsensical
person
once
when
we
went
to
a
friend
'
s
house
he
walked
in
first
and
shut
the
door
firmly
behind
him
i
felt
that
he
did
not
respect
me
and
moreover
i
was
his
friend
so
he
should
not
have
behaved
like
that
i
was
very
angry
(
as
it
is
i
was
in
a
bad
mood
then
)while
doing
some
calculation
exercises
,
i
neglected
a
part
of
it
,
though
i
had
marked
it
as
done
by
chance
,
i
was
asked
to
demonstrate
this
very
part
on
the
blackboard
i
was
in
a
dark
cellar
and
saw
a
glowing
red
point
i
thought
that
it
was
a
person
with
a
cigarette
but
it
was
only
the
red
switchthat
if
ever
i
was
really
naughty
i
would
be
sent
away
from
my
mum
and
dad
to
another
family
i
was
fostered
from
age
5
and
didn
'
t
get
to
mum
and
dad
until
i
was
6
and
then
legally
adopted
at
14
my
parents
failed
to
visit
me
as
they
promisedwhen
i
found
out
that
the
seat
in
the
coach
that
i
had
booked
had
been
sold
to
somebody
else
sitting
alone
in
a
quiet
room
,
concetrating
on
things
happening
around
you
thoughts
come
into
my
mind
which
make
me
afraidevery
time
i
imagine
that
someone
i
love
or
i
could
contact
a
serious
illness
,
even
death
when
i
got
home
from
my
job
,
i
found
a
letter
from
the
university
telling
me
that
i
had
been
admitted
to
begin
my
studiesit
was
last
week
on
saturday
night
when
i
was
at
mchesi
i
feared
to
cross
the
lilongwe
river
bridge
to
come
back
to
school
due
to
darkness
until
somebody
had
to
escort
me
i
went
home
late
one
evening
and
saw
that
the
security
lights
were
off
i
got
inside
the
gate
and
just
then
i
realized
that
the
dogs
may
be
outsidelying
to
my
grandparents
about
visiting
my
boyfriend
in
chico
i
felt
joyful
when
i
heard
that
i
had
been
selected
for
college
educationin
a
discussion
the
leader
wanted
to
stop
because
she
was
of
the
opinion
that
we
were
not
involved
and
she
misjudged
our
reactions
as
negative
we
however
only
posed
several
questions
which
she
couldn
'
t
answer
i
felt
angry
when
repeated
pleas
to
the
ticket
collector
and
the
co
passengers
in
order
to
make
a
queue
fell
on
deaf
ears
i
have
this
feeling
whenever
someone
is
not
disciplined
and
methodic
in
doing
his
dutywhen
i
failed
one
of
the
tests
because
i
had
not
worked
hard
enough
one
evening
,
i
was
with
a
group
of
friends

a
talk

was
a
very
trustful
and
joyful
atmospherei
was
angry
when
somebody
stole
my
half
petticoat

by
myself
and
a
few
weeks
ago

by
a
man
on

coming
up

bed
at
me
i
was
really
angry
,
told
him
to
get
out
he
was
surprised
,
hesitated
i
started
to
move
towards
him
and
he
backed
off
kept
telling
him
loudly
,
but
firmly
to
go
because
i
'
d
got
the
initiative
,
i
succeeded

very
powerful
messagesome

with
certain
persons

as

me
because
a
lot
of
my
close
friends
were
guys
and
he
didn
'
t
want
me
to
see
them

overhastingly

or

in
abnormal
psychology
i
felt
ashamed
i
felt
guilty
after
getting
really
angry
with
a
friend
and
having
an
argument
i
was
being
stubborn
and
proud
,
and
selfish
,
because
my
friend
let
me
down
,
through
no
fault
of
her
owni
studied
medicine
for
several
semesters
i
was
always
disgusted
when
we
had
the
dissecting
course
i
cannot
understand
why
some
persons
like
this
course
failing
in
an
examnwhen
the
student
union
leaders
were
expelled
from
the
university
and
we
continued
to
study
my
daughter
was
a
baby
and
was
crying
to
be
taken
on
my
lap
i
felt
very
nervous
and
moved
her
away
and
went
out
as
soon
as
the
feeling
of
nervousness
passed
i
was
taken
by
an
enormous
feeling
of
guilt
,
for
having
rejected
my
daughterwhen
i
was
accepted
to
study
at
this
school
i
was
very
happy
when
my
grandfather
diedi
was
sexually
assaulted
one
night
by
a
stranger
saw
in
the
tv
south
korea
cheating
in
the
asian
olympic
gamesi
had
a
date
with
a
friend
to
see
a
movie
and
my
friend
was
late
i
waited
for
a
long
hour
and
was
very
angry
when
my
term
paper
was
evaluatedmy
boyfriend
made
me
a
proposal
during
carnaval
i
danced
for
a
few
minutes
normally
i
don
'
t
dance
because
i
am
rigid
in
my
moving
around
during
a
dance
,
i
stopped
very
soonafter
a
disagreement
between
my
parents
,
when
i
was
alone
with
my
father
and
my
sister
,
the
aggression
continued
,
when
my
father
tried
to
put
me
and
my
sister
against
my
mother
revealing
facts
that
had
happened
in
the
past
like
a
talk
between
my
father
and
his
mother
in
law
where
she
told
him
that
my
mother
was
not
quite
save
over
an
argumenti
had
not
studied
very
much
for
my
final
examination
at
school
,
so
i
had
to
take
an
additional
examination
in
french
the
oral
examination
was
not
very
hard
for
me
the
more
i
was
glad
when
i
heard
that
i
had
passed
it
upon
moving
away
from
home
for
the
first
time
to
a
different
city
,
i
felt
no
longer
under
the
wing
of
my
parents
even
though
they
would
always
be
there
to
help
me
i
felt
a
sense
of
loss
,
i
was
now
all
alone
in
the
world
,
responsible
for
my
own
actionsa
drunk
man
bumped
into
me
and
wanted
to
grip
me
fortunately
i
was
able
to
break
loose
i
felt
disgust
when
i
kissed
a
guy
that
i
know
i
was
on
the
outs
with
my
boyfriend
and
this
person
appeared
but
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
mesomebody
was
blaming
me
of
a
story
which
was
not
real
and
not
true
without
my
permission
,
my
son
had
made
popcorn
after
coming
back
from
school
the
consequences
were
a
spoilt
kettle
and
chaos
in
the
kitchen
but
what
could
have
happened
with
the
hot
grease
?such
a
feeling
springs
up
in
me
sometimes
when
i
have
meals
at
a
catering
establishment
it
is
a
result
either
of
the
look
of
the
food
or
when
watching
the
way
some
people
eat
when
passing
the
final
examinations
for
social
workeri
was
caught
doing
something
bad
and
i
bribed
the
person
who
caught
me
later
i
felt
very
bad
,
maybe
i
should
have
paid
for
my
bad
behaviour
when
i
was
forced
to
decline
the
invitation
to
my
mother
'
s
70th
birthday
because
of
my
work
committments
in
another
areafrom

at

because
he
was

an
end
to
our
relationship
by
this
i
lost
an
important
source
of
support
,
certainty
and
joyful
moments
i
cried
very
intensly
when
that
happened
when
coming
up
for
trial
because
of
shop
liftingwhen
i
was
stopped
by
plain
clothes
policemen
because
the
car
i
was
driving

overturned
on
the
avenue
i
had
been
driving
too
fast
,
and
i
was
afraid
when
i
was
stopped
,
questionned
and
then
toild
to
go
the
situation
ended
happily
since
there
were
no
consequences
my
boyfriend
hinted
over
the
phone
about
wanting
to

lecturethe
fact
that
i
hadn
'
t
been
informed

the
greatest
trust
in
this

discussion
between
my
parentsi
remember
that
my
form
2
teacher
was
very
fierce
and
dogmatic
my
feet
would
tremble
whenever
i
saw
her
but
i
had
to
face
the
fact
that
i
had
to
go
for
her
class
i
had
wasted
some
time
instead
of
doing
something
i
needed
to
do
to
give
to
a
friend
(
also
in
the
time
i
wasted
i
had
done
some
things
i
did
not
consider
morally
right
)i
read
about
a
monk
who
had
been
murdered
and
put
into
a
barrel
which
was
filled
with
blood
of
pigs
i
imagined

footsteps
up
the
hall
while
sleeping
in

night
by
myself
in
the
housefalling

kind
word
last
year
i
put
off
an
exam
for
the
autumn
session
without
knowing
if
there
was
a
supplementary
examination
session
when
i
came
home
with
my
exam
unpassed
i
felt
guilty
before
my
parents

my
granny

i
did
not
know
how
to
tune
a
radio
i
received
a
letter
which
was
too
strong
for
me
it
said
i
had
done
something
which
i
really
didn
'
t
doi
feel
this
emotion
very
often
when
i
try
to
express
my
feelings
in
public
,
because
other
people
do
not
understand
my
reactions
and
think
that
i
am
silly
i
was
misbehaving
in
the
agencymy
car
skidded
on
the
wet
street
when
i
saw
my
father
coming
out
of
the
bathroom
he
thought
that
he
was
alone
at
home
and
came
out
without
his
clothesi
am
a
sportwoman
as
well
i
felt
joy
when
after
an
year
of
practice
,
at
a
contest
,
i
covered
the
norms
for
a
master
of
sports
in
a
park
near
our
home
,
a
group
of
young
people
who
were
strangely
dressed
were
seated
in
the
middle
of
the
street
they
began
to
eat
while
carressing
each
otherwhen
i
feigned
sick
leave
from
work
in
a
certain
book
i
read
about
cruelties
and
violence
in
prison
and
souteneur
circles
i
felt
especially
disgusted
when
i
read
detailed
descriptions
of
physical
and
mental
torture
of
less
powerful
peoplewhen
i
inadvertantly
made
some
close
friends
and
relatives
feel
bad
i
was
very
pleased
and
happy
when
my
older
sister

me
it

be
better
for
me
not
to
be
on
familiar
terms
with
another
friend
,
although
,
in
my
opinion
he
had
no
reason
to
say
such
things
he
only
said
so
hoping
that
i
would
search
support
from
him
(
that
,
however
,
was
not
necessary
)
when
i
was

i
was
defeated
we
were
at
secondary
school
and
i
was
making
a

of
noise
the

came
to
ask
us
as
to
who
was
making
all
the
noise
i
did
not
own
up
so
the
whole
class
was
punishedwhen
i
got
separated
from
my
first
love
a
friend
of
mine
tried
to
persuade
me
to
go
at
her
place
to
act
as
a
model
because
she
felt
too
tired
it
was
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
appointed
time
,
i
had
just
lied
down
and
did
not
want
to
go
because
it
was
too
late
anyway
she
said
that
i
only
was
talking
about
looking
for
work
,
but
if
it
was
possible
i
would
not
accept
it
i
was
angry
about
this
unjust
judgmentwhen
i
discovered
that
my
girlfriend
was
going
around
with
another
boy
when
i
wanted
to
talk
to
someone
i
liked
and
whom
i
have
been
told
likes
me
(
by
his
brother
and
even
by
himself
)
however
he
avoids
any
confrontation
,
and
is
vaguewhen
my
father
a
4th
5th
generation
colonial
(
from
eng
)
attacked
me
verbally
about
my
chosen
partner
a
man
whom
he
discarded
because
his
colour
skin
was
not
white
his
ultimate
disgust
saddned
me
scoring
a
goal
in
football
matchyelled
at
my
parents
for
not
buying
me
a
car
like
other
parents
i
feel
sad
when
i
see
things
done
against
men
and
nothing
could
stop
it
at
least
i
think
soa
night
spent
with
a
group
of
friends
i
read
a
book
about
the
situation
in
south
africa
,
about
the
terrible
violations
of
human
rights
i
was
disgusted
with
the
white
populationone
day
in
the
tyba
class
the
teacher
asked
me
a
very
simple
question
which
i
could
not
answer
finally
the
teacher
himself
gave
us
the
answer
and
my
friends
started
laughing
at
me
as
i
had
not
been
able
to
answer
a
simple
question
i
knew
the
answer
but
feared
that
my
response
may
be
wrong
all
this
made
me
feel
ashamed
of
myself
walking
home
at
night
after
university

of
the
way
,
there
are
ano
lights
and
i
am

said
bad
things

had
betrayed
me
by
making

some
tickets
for
a
concert
which
i
considered
important

term
party
last
week
and
had
fun
was
happy
and
sang
and
drank
only
soft
drinks
it
is
possible
to
have
a
good
time
without
alcohol
i
took
french
leave
to
do
my
homeworka
group
of
youngsters
dressed
in
fads
talked
foul
language
on
a
bus
they
also
insulted
the
pedestrians
on
the
road
and
were
impolite
to
the
passengers
of
the
bus
when
i
watched
a
report
about
el
salvador
on
tv
,
i
saw
people
who
had
been
murdered
by
terrible
methodsseeing
maltreated
,
dead
animals
when
i
heard
my
sister
got
in
a
bad
car
accidentduring
the
last
academic
year
i
e
1983
1984
just
before
the
closure
,
we
were
surrounded
and
threatened
by
the
paramilitary
forces
before
an
examination
i
had
the
fealing
that
i
had
not
learned
enoughour
boarder
burping
after
meals
!
when
i
failed
an
exam
for
which
i
knew
that
i
had
not
studied
hard
enougha
time
when
,
as
part
of
my
work
,
i
was
sent
out
actually
sort
of
volunteered
to
run
an
errand
for
someone
who
had
no
authority
to
send
me
out
and
the
address
was
very
far
especially
on
foot
and
turned
out
to
be
incorrect
too
the
whole
trip
was
a
waste
when
they
phoned
me
from
great
britain
to
tell
me
that
i
could
go
there
,
if
i
wished
,
in
summerwhen
i
recently
thought
about
the
hard
work
it
takes
to
study
,
and
how
one
wants
to
try
something
else
when
i
read
a
theoretical
book
in
english
that
i
did
not
understand
my
dog
,
whom
i
had
had
for
eleven
years
,
died
i
watched
his
soporificationi
had
written
a
love
letter
to
a
class
mate
of
mine
,
this
was
meant
to
be
a
joke
unfortunately
it
fell
in
the
wrong
hands
and
i
had
to
face
the
consequences
i
had
to
tell
someone
that
i
was
interested
in
remaining
celibate
and
alone
and
that
my
spiritual
master
strictly
prohibited
sexual
relations
outside
of
marriage
this
caused
great
fear
through
lack
of
conviction
afraid
to
hurt
someone
'
s
feelings
despite
my
own
being
hurt
in
the
processwhen
my
bosom
friend
tried
to
lie
to
me
i
feel
disgust
with
some
people
when
i
see
what
they
are
capable
of
,
including
lack
of
any
dignity
,
when
trying
to
find
a
seat
in
the
tramwhen
i
felt
being
treated
unjustly
by
a
teacher
being
sexually
assulted
and
told
my
friends
about
it
(
we
cried
together
)at
the
airport
,
eighty
beer
cans
that
i
was
carrying
in
a
bag
spread
all
around
while
i
was
going
through
the
metal
detector
i
received
a
letter
from
my
college
telling
me
that
i
would
not
be
allowed
to
sit
for
the
exams
because
of
my
low
attendance
in
class
and
the
bad
experience
in
the
terminal
examsmy
brother
is
a
soldier
he
promised
to
come
home
in
a
furlough
but
in
the
last
moment
he
phoned
and
said
that
he
could
not
come
i
was
crossing
the
street
together
with
some
colleagues
of
mine
when
i
suddenly
found
myself
almost
under
the
wheels
of
a
trucka
friend
(
female
)
and
i
were
on
holiday
on
great
barrier
island
by
ourselves
one
night
we
were
nearly
raped
by
about
20
locals
they
came
to
our
bach
and
tried
to
break
the
doors
down
all
of
them
were
stoned
or
drunk
and
we
hid
under
the
bunks
and
were
totally
terrified
eventually
these
guys
gave
up
and
went
looking
for
us
on
the
beach
we
escaped
and
slept
in
the
bush
for
2
nights
when
i
was
notified
that
i
had
been
accepted
as
a
psychology
studentgetting
into
this
university
to
do
medicine
leaving
the
house
myself
and
a
female
friend
had
shared
for
6
8
months
because
of
the
friendship
which
developed
and
our
approach
to
each
other
in
occasional
instances
of
several
personal
criseswhen
a
few
girls
were
talking
rubbish
about
me
when
my
mother
had
a
nervous
illnesswhen
my
friends
did
not
ask
me
to
go
to
a
new
year
'
s
party
with
them
i
felt
it
when
i
felt
that
i
was
being
observed
as
an
object
of
pleasure
(
sexual
)
when
i
opened
and
took
off
a
shirt
in
a
classroom
at
p
v
ca

person
,
smelling
bad
and
unknown

been
in
a
hospital
for
a
week
and
i
still
haven
'
t
had
time
to
see
heri
borrowed
my
friend
'
s
radio
cassette
and
the
plug
cracked
and
some
pieces

off
when
the
plug
dropped
off
my
hands
when
i
was
getting
up
,
i
found
a
live
cockroach
in
my
bedroomi
am
disgusted
at
the
number
of
second
year
students
who
are
pregnant
illegitimately
this
feeling
comes
frequently
when
i
go
out
at
night
and
tell
my
mother
that
i
shall
come
back
early
but
then
i
get
home

i
did
not
speak
the
truth
after
my
vacations
,
one
day
after
a
lecture
it
occured
to
me
to
buy
a
rose
for
my
mother
we
went
together
to
a
pub
and
my
mother
told
me
that
she
would
be
getting
married
next
spring
i
did
not
known
about
it
and
so
was
all
the
more
gladwhen
my
sister
was
born
when
i
read
a
newspaper
article
on
a
young
girl
who
had
been
raped
and
assaulted
one
night
by
several
men
when
she
was

after
i
had
managed
to
fail
my
first
year
at

was
scared
as
to
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
my
future
i
didn
'
t
want
a
mundane
9
5
job
and
yet
i
didn

t
know
if
i
could
pay
my
way
through
an
unsubsidized
year
at
university
to
settle
down
and
continue
my
studieswhen
some
seniors
tried
to
scold
and
insult
some
juniors
on
account
of
what
the
juniors
were
supposed
to
have
said
at
secondary
school
i
did
not
do
my
homework
and
went
to
see
a
filmwhen
my
colleague
spat
on
my
face
after
a
quarrel
when
i
was
told
that
i
had
no
right
to
control
my
loverwhen
i
entered
a
brothel
and
saw
two
sailors
with
a
young
prostitute

h
k
we
all
got
together
for
the
funeral

time
i
felt
extremely
sadgetting
into
this
university

never

sad
moments

night
i
saw
a
drunk
man
and
a
woman
who
were
quarreling
,
beating
each
other
,
shouting
and
so
on
i
felt
disgusted
especially
because
they
treated
each
other
in
such
a
degrading
waydisgust
is
a
feeling
that
i
have
never
experienced
with

ran
to
the
board
and
saw
that

was
really
included
in
the
list

was
so
excited
that
i
smiled
all
day
long
when
i
met
my
classmates
and
friends

told
them
the
good
news

was
so
happy

person
who
had
done
much
for
me
and
who
had
helped
me

everythinggoing
out
for
dinner
,
or
during
one
ice
cream
and
four
spoons
i
was
given
an

thought

not
measure
at
all
my
ability
or
my
knowledge
of
the
subjectfinding
out
some
people
had
been
talking
about
me
at
my
back

not
get
into
the
university

wanted
to
get
inafter
having
told
an
authority
figure
a
very
large
lie
i
was
told
she
believed
me
,
because
she
believed
i
had
never
lied
to
her
when
i
offend
somebody
unfairlyi
broke
off
with
my
partner
as
i
wanted
him
as
a
friend
and
not
as
a
lover
he
reacted
very
violently
and
i
felt
guilty
as
i
had
made
him
so
desperately
unhappy

were

episode
when
my
b
a

had
asked
the
teacher
to
write
a
recommendation
letter
for
me
,
but
i
had
not
provided
enough
information
and
had
run
short

time
the

instead
of

with

it
is
often
a
mistake
but
it
makes
me
angrymy
mother
unjustly
became
very
angry
with
me
and
sent
me
to
my
room
while
my
father
explained
that
the
way
she
saw
things
was
not
correct
i
had
done
things
with
the
best
intentions
when
i
found
out
my
roommate
had
been
talking
behind
my
back
about
very
personal
thingswhen
i
passed
the
driving
test
three
weeks
ago
and
got
my
licence
when
i
answered
to
my
mother
with
rudenessour
headmaster
came
to
our
hostel
the
lights
were
off
but
there
was
a
lot
of
noise
we
shouted
at
him
when
he
knocked
at
our
door
we
later
saw
that
it
was
the
headmaster
a
higher
status
colleague
of
mine
despised
my
attitude
and
organization
of
worki
last
really
felt
sad
when
i
left
home
for
i
was
leaving
all
my
long
time
,
pre
kindergarten
relationships
behind
i
borrowed
20
00
from
a
friend
and
paid
him
back
much
later
than
i
had
originally
intendedit
happened
in
a
tram
some
older
people
started
to
grumble
about
the
young
people
just
because
i
had
not
immediately
left
my
seat
to
them
when
a
skunk
invaded
campi
thought
that
someone
was
angry
with
me
but
,
by
hindsight
,
that
didn
'
t
appear
to
be
the
case
,
he
even
liked
me
when
my
father
passed
awaymy
classmate
used
her
personal
relations
to
get
a
seat
for
a
subject
that
i
wanted
also
i
had
taken
the
pains
to
help
him
apply
and
i
did
not
get
selected
i
did
not
like
this
as
he
had
not
told
me
the
facts
earlier
,
he
need
not
have
lied
to
me
when
a
girl
said
in
my
back
that
we
were
in
love
,
and
she
had
actually
refused
me
when
i
confronted
her
she
started
insulting
memy
best
friend
suddenly
acting
strange
towards
me
when
i
heard
about
the
treatment
of
a
friend
in
jail
really
inhuman
i
never
realised
that
such
things
also
happen
in
the
netherlandsquite
recently
i
realized
that
i
had
had
some
erroneous
views
about
life
for
instance
,
i
had
always
lived
for
other
people
,
had
forgotten
my
own
person
and
suppressed
my
own
feelings
i
was
ashamed
because
i
had
not
been
concious
of
that
until
i
had
a
conversation
about
it
with
a
person
i
was
in
a
camp
and
went
out
for
a
walk
at
night
on
my
own
i
lost
my
way
and
spent
several
hours
looking
for
the
campno
response
my
third
grade
teacher
caught
me
cheating
on
a
spelling
test

couldn
'
t
spell

and
she
said
in
a
loud
voice
something
like
we
don
'
t
have
cheaters
in
my
classwhen
i
failed
the
grade
7
exams
out
of
sheer
curiosity
,
i
went
to
see
a
pornographic
movie
in
copenhagen
the
room
was
full
of
men
,
who
panted
and
masturbated
very
disgustingi

to
prepare
relish
for
the
family
i
overcooked
it
and
no
one
liked
the
meal
that
day
on
school
,
during
a
fancy
fair
,
there
was
a
stand
of
amnesty
international
there
i
read
(
for
the
first
time
)
a
description
of
the
tortures
of
a
woman
,
what
they
did
to
herno
answer
as
i
see
very
little
difference
between
shame
and
guilt
therefore
see

for
shame
i
saw
a
program
on

where
they
had
to

for
weeks
as

did
not
want
to

on
with
my
work

the
only
alternative

in
the

to
their
actions
espwhile
in
the
army
,
i
was
treated
unfairly
by
my
superiors

was
held
responsible
for
a
deed
of
which
i
was
innocent
after
having
slept
for
a
short
time
i
woke
up
i
had
the
feeling
of

their
presentation
of
a
kidnapped

was
the
reason
behind

old
son
grab

oxygen
mask
as

dilation
of
his
breathing

caused
a
sense

when

year
but
only
the

aftertoo
busy
to

they
said
i
had
forgotten
about
them
when
i
had
broken
a
piece
of
glass
of
the
refrigerator
by
putting
a
hot
pan
in
itmy
parents
do
not
like
my
friend
and
told
me
not

when
i
had
been
angry
at
my
friend
without
any
reasoni
wanted
to
take
something
from
under
my
bed
while
doing
this
i
felt
a
dead
bird
laying
under
my
bed
i
was
alone
at
home
,
in
bed
reading
a
womens
'
magazine
in
which
there
were
storiees
of
paranormal
experiences
my
leg
was
itching
and
i
stretched
my
hand
to
scratch
and
i
felt
another
strange
hand
(
later
i
realized
that
it
was
the
corner
of
the
blanket
)i
experienced
this
when
my
maternal
grandmother
passed
away
she
was
the
last
of
my
grand
parents
to
pass
away
when
i
learnt
that
my
best
friend
had
failed
the
examswhen
i
was
punished
in
school
for
no
serious
mistake
of
mine
when
i
became
conscious
that
men
don
'
t
wnat
anything
they
don
'
t
have
a
goal
they
have
sex
,
but
this
isn
'
t
importanti
had
worked
very
hard
during
my
vacations
to
raise
some
money
for
a
few
major
items
(
e
g
a
radio
)
but
when
i
arrived
at
the
inter
city
bus
terminal
,
my
hard
earned
money
had
been
stolen
from
me
christmas
eve
there
was
a
tension
between
my
parents
,
they
did
not
even
try
to
restore
a
harmonic
atmosphere
mother
stayed
in
her
room
almost
the
whole
day
i
felt
alone
and
was
very
sadwhen
i
was
in
the
army
,
we
got
a
certain
dish
for
dinner
that
i
do
not
like
at
all
we
were
not
obliged
to
eat
,
but
i
was
very
hungry
i
felt
happy
when
my
mother
borrowed
me
the
car
in
order
to
let
me
go
out
alone
for
the
first
timethis
came
in
when
at
one
time
i
met
a
girl
who
i
didn
'
t
expect
to
fall
in
love
with
me
fortunately
i
tried
my
luck
and
she
accepted
my
proposal
at
the
same
time
she
was
giving
me
a
lot
of
money
which
was
just
like
a
miracle
to
me
when
my
grandmother
died
very
suddenly
without
warningabout
the
girl
(
22
years
,
married
)
i
felt
guilty
of
the
relationship
when
i
was
selected
to
a
university
college
of
nursingwith
my
mouth
full
of
bun
,
i
drank
directly
from
a
packet
of
milk
which
turned
out
to
be
weeks
old
(
completely
separated
)
it
took
a
while
for
the
milk
to
seep
through
the
bun
once
i
arrived
two
hours
late
to
my
work
place
(
a
bank
)
and
i
was
still
feeling
feeble
and
tiredwhen
i
saw
my
brother
being
attacked
and
i
could
not
do
anything
i
arrived
an
hour
late
for
an
important
meeting
(
i
had
misunderstood
the
time
)i
had
left
a
student
newspaper
of
the
chinese
university
on
the
table
of
the
library
it
had
disappeared
when
i
came
back
once
when
i
said
bad
things
concerning
a
friendwhen
diving
deep
into
the
sea
to
reach
the
floor
i
felt
breathless
i
was
cautious
but
i
doubted
i
should
be
able
to
come
to
the
surface
and
inhale
when
two
drug
addicts
tried
to
take
away
my
moneyit
was
august
30th
when
i
heard
on
the
radio
that
i
passed
my
m
c
e
exams
and
i
was
really
happy
and
joyous
because
of
the
event
when
i
was
accused
of
something
i
had
not
donei
felt
guilty
about
talking
negatively
,
and
agreeing
with
a
person
who
was
doing
likewise
,
about
a
non
present
third
person
my
father
gave
me
money
for
school
fees
and
i
didn
'
t
pay
school
fees
instead
i
spent
it
on
beer
and
did
not
tell
him
about
thiswhen
a
friend
woke
me
up
in
the
middle
of
a
blessful
sleep
by
knocking
on
the
door
then
he
started
calling
me
names
and
saying
that
he
had
heard
that
i
had
been
talking
behind
his
back
,
this
was
a
lie
and
the
guy
was
drunk
to
the
core
the
long
lasting
illness
of
my
grand
mother
,
and
the
changes
in
family
relationships
caused
by
itwhen
i
lost
my
father
on
the
25th
of
september
,

a
sore

leg

i
was
very
happy
when
i
passed
and
went
to
form
i
it
was
a
great
relief
for
me
as
i
had
been
very
worried
considering
the
large
number
of
pupils
who
faili
felt
disgust
of
my
father
when
i
knew
he
had
a
lover
when
i
knew

had
to

the
extent
of
the
damage
until
he
showed
it
to
me
the
next
day
the
shock
on
my
face
was
genuine
so
a
friend
interceded
with
a
good
excuse
which
i
did
not
deny
i
never
clarified
the
situationwhen
my
father
was
involved
in
an
accident

,
rather
than

reasons
etc

every
time
i
think
of
very
dear
friends
of

to
me
for
a
year
,
and
now
2
years
later

but
have
not
actually
gone
through
with
corresponding
with
them
,
to
express
my
feelings
and
gratitude
coming
to
this
lecture
and
listen
to
you
talking
about
feelings
,
i
am
so
happy
that

the
indian
prime
minister

a
typical
family
argumentwhen

a
child

told
my
mother
a
lie
and
she
found
it
out
when
we
had
swimming
instruction
,
we
had
to
take
a
header
from
the
springboard
i
usually
refused
to
do
that
,
but
at
least
i
was
forced
towhen
i
was
appointed
by
the
ministry
of
health
to
join
the
teaching
staff
of
one
of
the
medical
colleges
during
a
summer
holiday
at
a
bar
i
happened
to
see
a
dead
to
the
world
womanthe
man
who
threw
me
out
of
the
flat
disgusted
me
when
i
needed
another
job
and
tought
that
a
good
and
known
person
(
my
employer
)
could
help
me
he
simply
said
that
he
couldn
'
t
help
meduring
my
childhood
when
i
could
not
get
what
i
wanted
from
my
brother
sister
and
parents
we
were
camping
in
the
mountains
,
and
a
friend
and
i
went
for
a
walk
it
was
getting
darker
and
darker
and
we
were
not
sure
of
the
right
way
backwhen
a
close
friend
died
i
was
travelling
back
home
by
boat
with
two
friends
of
mine
after
a
lovely
holiday
trip
the
night
and
the
sea
were
dark
,
and
the
wind
was
blowing
i
feared
that
death
was
there
on
the
boat
,
i
somehow
felt
sure
about
it
i
feared
being
left
aloneafter
a
hard
day
at
the
university
i
also
had
to
make
dinner
that
evening
it
failed
because
of
a
frying
pan
which
broke
i
was
totally
unprepared
for
a
seminar
conducted
by
an
assistant
professor
whom
i
highly
respectwhen
i
was
at
an
official
meeting
i
asked
a
question
to
a
person
his
response
was
not
directed
at
me
but
at
the
chairman
getting
illwhen
i
received
a
letter
from
the
university
telling
me
that
my
application
had
been
accepted
i
am
quite
shameless
,
not
applicablehaving
my
luggage
checked
at
customs
when
i
saw
the
certificate
results
,
i
did
not
feel
very
happy
as
i
did
not
realize
that
i
had
got
all
the
credits
until
my
classmates
pointed
it
out
to
me
my
parents
and
my
relatives
praised
me
and
i
realized
that
my
results
were
good
i
e
2a
,
5b
,
2c
i
felt
satisfied
with
the
results
and
was
happywhen
i
broke
my
leg
i
felt
fear
i
experienced
this
feeling
when
i
was
accepted
as
a
student
because
everything
turned
out
different
from
my
expectations
although
i
passed
the
exam
successfully
i
was
accepted
as
a
student
only
when
i
didn
'
t
expect
it
at
all
,
namely
at
the
beginning
of
septembernot
noticing
my
roommates
quietness
or
a
sign
of
discomfort
when
i
saw
an
accident
where
the
man
lost
his
headi
was
on
a
farm
with
a
few
friends
and
during
the
talk
i
discovered
that
a
friend
of
mine
,
was
being
betrayed
by
her
boyfriend
and
a
3rd
friend
of
ours
due
to
laziness
,
i
failed
the
term
studies
completely
at
university
i
also
wanted
,
to
some
extent
,
to
protest
against
my
parents
'
expectationssome
time
ago
a
man
tried
to
teach
me
something
tried
because
it
is
very
difficult
to
teach
somebody
when
you
yourself
are
not
competent
and
cultured
one
night
my
father
suddenly
suffered
from
a
heart
attack
which
lead
to
breathing
difficultiesi
promised
my
friends
that
i
would
take
care
of
something
,
but
i
kept
forgetting
about
it
when
they
asked
me
about
it
,
i
promised
to
do
it
immediately
however
,
i
got
started
only
after
a
couple
of
months
i
felt
that
i
had
betrayed
my
friends
my
sweetheart
left
me
,
or
rather
we
decided
to
break
it
off
by
mutual
consent
the
consequences
were
unrestrained
weeping
,
feelings
of
loneliness
,
hopelessness
and
disconsolation
i
felt
that
i
should
find
a
friend
,
to
talk
to
joyfully
and
to
forgetat
the
begining
of
a
new
course
one
is
afraid
of
encountering
problems
one
can
not
manage
thoughts
revolve
around
failing
the
subject
and
the
consequences
it
would
have
for
the
future
when
i
wanted
to
go
into
a
house
,
there
was
suddenly
a
big
dog
standing
beside
me
it
was
hardly
moving
,
but
i
did
not
know
how
it
would
react
later
onthis
happened
recently
,
i
was
in
the
dining
hall
and
one
of
my
friends
with
whom
i
was
eating
called
me
a
fool
i
was
to
meet
a
girl
in
a
discotheque
she
was
very
pretty
and
i
was
very
happy
but
she
did
not
turn
up
thank
god
,
there
were
some
other
friends
there
and
i
was
able
to
have
a
more
or
less
good
timeno
response
i
had
intercourse
with
someone
and
then
i
realized
that
what
i
had
done
was
wrong
and
it
disgusted
mei
once
caught
a
letter
in
my
girlfriend
'
s
handbag
from
a
certain
man
i
felt
anger
when
dad
went
to
a
sports
day
and
was
the
only
parent
there
,
and
he
was
cheering
for
usstaying
in
a

driver
at
my
workplace
to
lie
and
tell
the
boss
that
it
was
not
me
who
was
responsible
for
the
delay
the
boss
was
very
annoyed
and
the
driver
was
punished
and
a
day

s
salary
was
taken
away
from
himwhen
i
heard
that

from

watching
a
movie
in
which
there

of
dangers
and
there
